            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An Accompt of the Treatiſe
and Publication.</head>
            <p>THE General Heads of this Diſcourſe,
(with other ſound Principles, generally
owned by the Churches of <hi>Britain</hi>) the
Authour was ſomewhat Inſtructed-in
from his Childhood; and had heard but little of
their contraries, till a few years ſince, that he fell in
acquaintance with ſome who held the General Point:
<hi>That,</hi> he means, which would make the Grace of God
in Chriſt, to be <hi>General</hi> and <hi>alike to All;</hi> ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the whole ſucceſs thereof on the Humane Will;
without any <hi>peculiar</hi> Aſſiſtance afforded to <hi>Any,</hi> but
what is given in <hi>Common</hi> unto <hi>Men.</hi> Which yet he
thinks more rightly term'd <hi>General,</hi> as having the
<hi>Generality of Men in Nature,</hi> for Abettors of it. Not
that he thinks All who hold for it, to be in a Natural
ſtate; For, as of <hi>Moſt</hi> the Judgement is better than
their practiſe; ſo, of <hi>Some</hi> he hopes the practiſe may
be ſounder than their Judgment: But ſo to hold, and
practiſe accordingly, he cannot but judge extremely
perilous to the Souls of Men.</p>
            <p>Divers occaſional conferences he had with thoſe of
That way: In all which he found it their drift to
Inſinuate <hi>that</hi> Principle: (Not caring much to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of any thing elſe, but ſtill diverting into that
channell:) And this, with that Confidence of their
own, and contempt of the contrary Judgment; ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comly
Reflections (from ſome of them) upon their Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents,
and ſlight regard of the Scriptures brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb facs="tcp:60927:3"/>
them; as in no wiſe beſeem'd a Contending for
the <hi>Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He alſo found their opinion moſtly grounded upon
words and phraſes of a variable interpretation; Not
weighing the <hi>Scope</hi> of the Text, nor how the ſenſe they
gave of it, might accord with thoſe of a contrary Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.
It was ſtill their way, to bring Thoſe that were
plain and expreſs, to be tryed by thoſe of a doubtful
ſound: Whereas (indeed) the contrary Courſe had been
more Regular, and likely to find-out the Truth.</p>
            <p>Not that any Scripture is doubtful in it ſelf, or
would ſeem ſo to us; were the ſcope and context right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
underſtood: But, the ſame word being uſed in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
places to a different purpoſe; for want of well-obſerving,
or rightly taking the Scope, is eaſily turn'd
from its proper Intendment.</p>
            <p>It is true, he found among them a general agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
againſt our Doctrine of Election: and yet, as
much differing among themſelves as they do from
us: <hi>Some</hi> holding Election, upon Faith <hi>foreſeen; O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi>
That Men are taken into delightful Love when
they do <hi>actually</hi> beleive, and not before; Others of
them, That there is no Man Elected till he hath <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevered</hi>
in Believing to the laſt Moment of his life;
And Others agen, That there is <hi>no Election at all,</hi> of
particular perſons as ſuch, but of the intire ſpecies of
Men from Eternity.</p>
            <p>This put him upon ſearching the Scriptures more
<hi>Setly,</hi> touching the Doctrine of Election; Wherein the
farther he went, the more he was confirm'd in what
he had firſt receiv'd. And as he went-on, found thoſe
other Points of <hi>Peculiar Redemption, Effectual
<pb facs="tcp:60927:3"/>
Calling,</hi> and <hi>Final Perſeverance,</hi> ſo interwoven with
That of <hi>Election,</hi> and <hi>dependent</hi> thereon; as very
Naturally induced a Diſcuſſion of Thoſe alſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And as
Preparatory thereto, it ſeemed expedient to preface th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
whole with the Doctrine of God's <hi>Sovereignity:</hi> the
reaſons whereof, with its uſefullneſs, you will find in the
Treatiſe it ſelf. It alſo lay before him, to obſerve, What
uſeful Inſtructions deriv'd from theſe Doctrines, above
Thoſe of the contrary tenor.</p>
            <p>Of this Work was oft-times a Stop and Laying-aſide,
as Reſolv'd to proceed no farther: Not ſo much from
the <hi>want,</hi> as <hi>Redundancy,</hi> of Matter, which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
to be in the Scriptures for it; but found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
too-narrow to make-it-out: Partly alſo, from the
difficulty of bringing his ſcattered Miſcellaneous
Notes, to a Conſiſtency. But, by one <hi>Impreſſing Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence</hi>
or Other, it ſtill Reviv'd and went-on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh;
till at length, his Gleanings grew into a ſhock;
Which then he bound-up and deſigned it a Legacy to
his Children, To whom onely he thought to commend it.</p>
            <p>But, ſo it was, (in the Providence of God,) That
ſome parts thereof came to the view and hearing of
ſeveral Antient and Sober Chriſtians, who expreſt a
very hearty Reſentment and Approbation of it; Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionately
wiſhing it might be printed, for more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
uſe; as That which might help to confirm the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure
of Thoſe already poſſeſs'd of the Truth, but ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
ſubject to ſifting.</p>
            <p>One amongſt them (who had caſt a favourable Aſpect
on the contrary Point;) profeſſed himſelf well-ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with what he had found in this, touching the Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency
of natural <hi>Free-will,</hi> tho' aſſiſted with General
<pb facs="tcp:60927:4"/>
Grace; <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rging alſo the publiſhing of it, For that he
thought, the plainneſs thereof might render it more
Convincing to ſome (that were looking another way)
than learned Diſputes.</p>
            <p>Another Conſideration (which alſo had its weight)
was laid in the Ballance; <hi>viz.</hi> The uſefulneſs it might
be of, To antidote young Profeſſors (or Probationers in
Religion;) who being ſcarſe out of the ſhell of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, are pronely Receptive of Notions
that ſpring from a Covenant of Works; which, by means
of ſo familiar a diſcourſe of Nature's weakneſs, with
the Neceſſity and Invincible efficacie of Divine Grace,
they might happily be Armed-againſt.</p>
            <p>Repeated inſtances prevailed (at length) for a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs
to make it publick; in caſe it ſhould alſo obtain
Approbation from approved Divines; whoſe Teſt and
Judgment he would firſt ſubmit it unto: Retaining
(nevertheleſſe) a deep ſenſe of his manifold inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
for ſuch a work; and praying, that his perſonal
weakneſs and obſcurity may not prejudice the Truth.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only add (by the way) a word of Religious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation:
That tho' it do not confer Grace, yet it
may prove (and hath ſo to many) a good Preſervative
from evils in practice, and errours in Judgment; which
others (who had not that Merciful advantage) have
more aptly fell-into. Beſides, When God comes to work
effectually; Thoſe Notions of ſin, of Chriſt, and of
Grace, (of which before, they had but the Form;) have
proved of ſingular uſe to facilitate the work.</p>
            <p>The Lord vouchſafe His preſence with it! Amen.</p>

PRACTICAL
DISCOURSE
OF
Gods Sovereignty.</head>
            <p>THis <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Fundamental</hi> Attribute I have
choſe to begin with, as a meet Introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the following diſcourſe; It being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
the foundation of all; and that which
gives Life and Virtue to every Divine
Truth: Without the knowledge whereof, (in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure)
and practical yielding thereto, we ſhall want a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
means of quieting our underſtandings, touching the
Points that follow. I gather the ſum of what I intend,
into this Propoſition; <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>That, Sovereign Power belongs to God.</q>
            <p>By [<hi>Sovereign Power</hi>] I underſtand, that <hi>abſolute Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
which the <hi>Great God,</hi> bleſſed for ever, hath over his
Creatures, to <hi>diſpoſe</hi> and <hi>determine</hi> them, as ſeemeth him
good.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:60927:5"/>
That there is ſuch a Power, and that this Power belongs
to God, no other Reaſon needs be aſſign'd, but that <hi>He is
God, and there is n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ne beſides him:</hi> There can be no
more, becauſe (1) There can be but one <hi>Infinite;</hi> for ſuch
a being fils Heaven and Earth; and ſo, no place or room for
another. (2) There can be but one <hi>Omnipotent,</hi> For, He
that is ſuch, hath all others under his feet; Beſides, where
One can do all, more would be impertinent. (3) There can
be but one Supream; Supream power may reſide in Many;
(as in mixt Monarchies and Common-wealths,) but as Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers
and Supream, they are but One. (4) There can be
but one firſt Cauſe, from which, all being elſe derive their
Original; and that is, this bleſſed <hi>One</hi> we are ſpeaking of;
<hi>Of whom, and for whom are all things,</hi> 1 Cor. 8. 6. And if he
be the <hi>Author</hi> of <hi>all,</hi> he needs muſt have a Sovereign Right
and Power to <hi>determine all;</hi> as to their being, ſo alſo, to their
Order, Efficacy, and End.</p>
            <p>It is a Truth ſo natural, and obvious to Reaſon it ſelf; that
other proof ſeems as needleſs, as that the Sun is the fountain
of light: Nor ſhall I ſuppoſe, that any who will read this
diſcourſe, can ſo far forget themſelves to be Creatures, as to
ſeek a proof of their Creators Sovereignty; The things that
are ſeen, ſo loudly proclaiming his Eternal power and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.
But ſince, with our eaſy admitting the <hi>Notion,</hi> it is
none of the ſmalleſt difficulties, to own it in our <hi>practiſe,</hi> and
bear our ſelves anſwerably towards him; Since alſo, ſo huge
a weight is born on the ſhoulders of this Supream Attribute,
and our ſouls are ſo highly concern'd in the <hi>intereſt and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences</hi>
of it; it needs muſt be our duty, and well worthy our
time, to look or the Inſtances of it, and to mark and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them well; as things greatly importing our Inſtruction;
whereby we may know ſomething of the <hi>Greatneſs</hi> of that
God, in whoſe hands our ſouls are; as alſo, of our infinite
diſtance from him, and nothingneſs to him; and ſo, with the
more humbleneſs of mind, and ſelf-abaſement; as alſo, with
the more Faith, and Creature-like affiance, ſubmit unto him,
and bear our ſelves upon him.</p>
            <p>To this end, the Scriptures have inrolled divers <hi>Enſignes</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:60927:5"/>
of Sovereignty, by which, as by ſo many footſteps, we are
led to the <hi>Abſolute Will,</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of God, as the Cauſe and
Ruler of <hi>all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Great</hi> Act of <hi>Sovereignty</hi> was Gods Decree for
making the World, and of doing, or permitting to be done
what ever ſhould be in it, to the folding of it up. The
Heavens and the Earth, and all the hoſts of them, as yet had
no being: It was at his pleaſure, <hi>whether</hi> he would make
them or not: And if he would, <hi>what</hi> being he would give
them; to what <hi>End,</hi> and <hi>how</hi> that end ſhould be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed.
And that theſe were <hi>all</hi> aſcertain'd by the Decree, is
evident; For, <hi>known unto God were all his works</hi> (which he
would do in time) <hi>from the beginning of the World.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 15. 18.</note> The
ſcheme and ſubſtance whereof, (and I hope, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſion)
may be drawn to this effect: That the <hi>Great God</hi>

forth in God's <hi>actual predominating</hi> the <hi>Spirits</hi> of Men; as

with the will of his <hi>Maker,</hi> as who muſt needs beſt
know, what is beſt for His Creature; and who, in Reaſon,
can have no other deſign upon him, but his own good. But,
we find it otherwiſe; the beſt things degenerated turn the
worſt, and are hardlieſt reduc'd: Of all Creatures, Man
fallen, doth moſt avert, impugn, and reſiſt, when God
would turn him out of his natural courſe; Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that the ſoreſt of evils do attend his preſent ſtate; and
all deſirable happineſs would apparently follow his change.
Yet, ſo wedded he is to his Luſts, and head-ſtrong in his

he goes, and On he will; yea, though an incenſed Angel, with
a drawn ſword, ſhould withſtand him. To cruſh them to

alſo is farther conſpicuous, in <hi>Maintaining</hi> the work begun;

the ſame Power to preſerve the new Creation, as at firſt to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60927:11"/>
raiſe it: The way of God, being altogether upwards and
ſupernaturall, there's a great proneneſſe in creatures to
Revolt from it; (like a Rolling ſtone on the ſteep of
a hill) The Remains of old nature, would torrent-like
bear down <hi>all,</hi> if Sovereign Power did not barr up the
One, and ſuſtain the Other. For a <hi>ſpark</hi> of <hi>Divine nature</hi>
to live in the breſt, of <hi>a lapſed</hi> Creature, is as <hi>great</hi> a miracle
and as high an effect of <hi>Sovereign</hi> Power, as all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
before enumerated, and More.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, The Sovereignty of God, is moſt glorious and
adorable, in Ordaining <hi>His own ſon,</hi> who was <hi>holy,
harmleſs, undefiled,</hi> and <hi>ſeperate from ſinners,</hi> and was alſo
United to the <hi>Second Perſon,</hi> to be the Mediator, and to

Eternal diſpoſing of Mens everlaſting condition. To <hi>ſhew,</hi>
or <hi>not</hi> to ſhew, Mercy unto Men equally dignified (or
rather, Indignified) in themſelves; To make, of the <hi>ſame</hi>

the higheſt act and demonſtration of Sovereign power
concerning Men: Which thing, when ever we hear of,
or think upon; we ſhould put our mouths in the duſt.</p>
            <p>Before <hi>I</hi> come to the Inferences, <hi>I</hi> would add a Caution
or two, to prevent thoſe ſiniſter deductious, which
our deceitfull hearts may be apt to draw from this Sover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eign
Truth:</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Caution. 1.</note> See that you make not God the Author of ſin,
by charging His ſacred Decrees with Men's Miſcarriages;
as if they were the <hi>Cauſe</hi> or <hi>Occaſion</hi> of them; which we
are ſure they are <hi>not,</hi> nor <hi>can</hi> be, any more than the
Sun is the cauſe of darkneſs. Be it alwaies remembred,
That the Lord's Rejecting of Men puts <hi>nothing</hi> of evil
into them; Nor neceſſitates the will; It only leaves them
to their <hi>own</hi> wayes, which they freely chooſe: yet <hi>Banking</hi>
them in and <hi>ſtopping</hi> them up, as He did the Fountains
of the Great Deep; leſt they <hi>Deluge</hi> the World with <hi>ſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Go not about to <hi>palliate,</hi> Nor think to
extenuate your ſin, by Arguments fetcht from thoſe Decrees:
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60927:11"/>
That ſin of the Iews in Crucifying Chriſt, was in no wiſe,
leſſened; becauſe <hi>the Councel of God had determin'd the thing
to be done:</hi> For, they perpetrated it with <hi>wicked hands.</hi>
Nor is any Man's Unbelief e'r the leſs <hi>culpable,</hi> from God's
<hi>Eternal diſpoſement</hi> of Mens conditions; For, it is not upon
<hi>that</hi> conſideration, that they ſtumble at the Word, or turn
the deaf ear to it; or reſiſt it: but from their own natural
blindneſs and enmity againſt it.</p>
            <p>And ſo I come to the Inferences: And</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Infer. 1.</note> From the Scriptures ſo <hi>copiouſly</hi> holding it forth,
I infer, That the Doctrine of God's Sovereignty is a very
<hi>teaching</hi> Doctrine, and full of inſtruction; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that it is both a <hi>Duty,</hi> and much for our <hi>Profit,</hi> to be well
acquainted with it: And great confidence I have, That the
farther ye go in an <hi>humble fiducial</hi> diſquiſition, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
of it; the clearer will be the <hi>Reaſon</hi> thereof;
and the <hi>more</hi> uſefulneſs will ſtill appear to be in it. Let Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
but keep its own place; (that is, let it work by the
Rules of <hi>Right</hi> Reaſon) and nothing will be more conſonant
thereto, than that <hi>the Moſt High ſhould bear rule over all,</hi>
and <hi>Do according to his Will;</hi> and that <hi>Men,</hi> who are Atoms
of <hi>Clay</hi> animated by <hi>his</hi> breath; ſhould own Him for their
<hi>Sovereign Lord,</hi> and accordingly ſubmit to Him; yea;
though ſo it were, that our own <hi>perſonal</hi> welfare were not
concerned in it: It will be of <hi>ſingular</hi> Uſe and Moment to us,
in the whole of our lives: Nothing, like this, will allay
thoſe carnal Reaſonings, which are ſo unreaſonably prone
to put in their Verdict of ſpiritual things; (which yet,
<hi>Carnal</hi> Reaſon hath no cogniſance of) and will (indeed)
be ſilenced by nothing elſe: The Apoſtle, therefore, in
Rom. 9.<note place="margin">ver. 19, 20, 21.</note> thinks them not worthy a further Reply, whoſe
<hi>captious</hi> Enquiries the <hi>Sovereignty</hi> of God will not ſatisfy.</p>
            <p>A ſecond Inſcrence,<note place="margin">Infer. 2.</note> which naturally flowes from this
Doctrine, is that of the Pſalmiſt: <hi>Oh, come let us Worſhip

            <p>Neither yet look on them as Things <hi>Contingent:</hi>

Or, <hi>why One event to them All?</hi> This is not to Enquire wiſely:

Caſe) <hi>The Lord hath need of them:</hi> That is, He hath occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to uſe ſuch a Providence, to fullfil a Word. If ye would
Caſt ſo, as to lye by your Mark, this Attribute of Sovereignty
gives you the beſt Ground. Search and Obſerve as much as
ye will, ſo you take Faith along with you; Without which
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60927:13"/>
ye can do Nothing <hi>Warrantably.</hi> Faith is a Sworn Officer to
the Great king, and has a key for every lock that is fit to be
opened; It forces Nothing; but where it cannot Enter, it
ſtands without, and Waits a fitter ſeaſon. Let Faith alſo,
be Chief Speaker in all your Debates: And then, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
will be, That Carnal Reaſon, and Preſent Senſe, (though
very Tenacious and Stubborn) ſhall yield the Cauſe, and let
you goe.</p>
            <p>The Summ of all, is this, That though ye be not Conſcious
to your ſelf, of any <hi>particular</hi> Cauſe or Miſcarriage, beſides
what is <hi>Common to</hi> Men, (which was the Caſe with <hi>Job)
Lay your hand upon your Mouth,</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> did; <hi>The Moſt High
doth according to His Will:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dan. 4. 34: 35.</note> This, even the proudeſt of Kings
acknowledged, <hi>when his underſtanding returned to him;</hi> and
ſo do you: And know, That if your ſpirit be out of frame
in your preſent Condition; it would not be better in any
other.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Our <hi>Faith</hi> alſo is highly concerned in the <hi>Sover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eignty</hi>
of God: For, It both <hi>obligeth</hi> to Believe in Him, and
alſo <hi>affords Matter</hi> for Faith to <hi>work</hi> upon. To <hi>theſe</hi> Ends,
the Lord holds it forth to <hi>Abraham</hi> Once and Again:<note place="margin">Gen. 17, 1.</note> 
               <hi>I am
God Almighty</hi> &amp;c. <hi>This</hi> was it, enabled him to <hi>believe</hi> he
ſhould have a Son; even whiles the Deadneſs of his own
Body,<note place="margin">Rom. 4. 19.</note> and of <hi>Sarah's</hi> Womb, wrought ſtrongly againſt it.
<hi>This</hi> alſo was <hi>that</hi> made him ſo <hi>readily aſſent</hi> to the offering
up of this Son, when he had him. He had as much to ſay
againſt it, as could well be ſuppoſed; For, the Promiſe was,
That <hi>in Iſaac all families of the Earth ſhould be bleſſed: which
Promiſe</hi> and <hi>this Command, Abraham's Reaſon</hi> could not
<hi>Reconcile:</hi> The Contradiction would ſurely have Run him
down, had not his faith in this Great Attribute, held faſt
and guided the Reignes; Suggeſting to him, That He who
<hi>gave Iſaac a being</hi> from <hi>a Withered</hi> Stock, was able alſo to
<hi>raiſe</hi> him from the dead:<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 19.</note> 
               <hi>Abraham</hi> there fore diſputes it Not;
Stands not ſo much as to <hi>conſider</hi> upon't: but up he gets
him <hi>Early,</hi> to do it: And hence he obtained that honourable
title,<note place="margin">James, 2. 23.</note> to be called, <hi>The friend of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ye have ſeen Now, what <hi>Abraham</hi> did; Go ye, and do
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60927:13"/>
likewiſe: Take hold of Gods Sovereignty as <hi>your own;</hi>
and to be improved for <hi>your good: Faith</hi> gives <hi>a Propriety</hi> in
any Attribute it looks upon; and drawes out the virtues and
Influence thereof, for it ſelf. And therefore, What ever diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
are in your way, be not diſheartened by them; but
call in this Sovereignty of God, by faith, to your help:
Remember the ready ſubjection which all Creatures do pay
to his Word; By which alone (without Creatures ſervice)
He can level the Mountains, and make Crooked things
ſtreight, Reſtra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>, Alter, Invert, and Turn upſide down,
the very Courſe of Nature: ſo that <hi>That</hi> which is death in
it ſelf, ſhall be life to you. New Cords and Wyths, when
touch'd by his word, are as flax and tow, when touch'd by the
fire; Iron ſhall be as ſtraw, and braſs as rotten wood:
Therefore, <hi>lengthen</hi> the Cords, and <hi>ſtrengthen</hi> the <hi>ſtakes</hi> of
your <hi>faith:</hi> you cannot beleive for greater things or better
than God can do for you: Even ſin it ſelf, which is the
Great (and in truth, the onely) evil; It is His enemy as
much as yours; And you may be ſure, He would not have
ſuffered its being in the World, if He had not a Power to
Correct and Curb it; yea, and to deſtroy it too, at His
pleaſure. Take hold of His ſovereign ſtrength, and your
work is done.</p>
            <p>But here alſo a Caution or two, may be ſeaſonably added.</p>
            <p>1. That if death in the pot have once been healed, and
your borrowed Ax-head, (ſunk once paſt hope of Recovery)
have been brought again to your hand, look that Remiſſnes
grow not upon it: Beware, ye gather not Wilde Gourds
a ſecond time; Nor perſume to throw the helve after the
Head: The Divine Power is too great a thing to be trifled
with; or Made to ſerve with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ollies of Men.</p>
            <p>2. That you never look on this Great Attribute of
Sovereignty, without your <hi>Mediator;</hi> As without whom
it would be matter of Terror and Amazemeut to ſinners:
It is <hi>He onely</hi> can render It <hi>Propitious</hi> to you. As Nothing is
pleaſing to God, but in and through Chriſt; So, Nothing
in God, is Comfortable to Men, or for their Eternal Good,
but as it comes to them <hi>through Him:</hi> As Waters out of

the Sea immediately, are not potable, unleſs they be firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haled

your Cauſe, and Commit it to Him as your <hi>Sovereign Lord;</hi>
and ſo leave it with Him; And ſee, that you take it not out
of His hand again, by your doubting the iſſue of it: And
know that <hi>then</hi> is your Soul neareſt to Peace and ſettle ment,
when brought to this Submiſſion: <hi>Be in ſubjection unto the

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60927:14"/>
by [<hi>Submiſſion</hi>] That you ſhould be ſatisfied under <hi>a denial</hi>
of Mercy, on the accompt of God's <hi>Abſolute Dominion:</hi>
I cannot think <hi>That</hi> a Neceſſary term or qualification, in your
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>reating with God for Salvation: For</p>
            <p>1. <hi>I</hi> do not find, That God requires ſuch a Submiſſion, as
the Condition of obtaining Mercy; Nor that He hath made
any Promiſe to give ſuch a Submiſſion, in order to that end;
Nor any Inſtance in ſcripture of Mens having or indeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſuch a frame of ſpirit, in that buſineſs; Nor yet, That
Men are any where tax'd for-Not att<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ning to it. They are
blamed indeed, and that worthily, For not ſubmitting to
the Righteouſneſs of God; (that is, For not Renouncing
their own, and flying to That of Chriſt:) And this blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs
you cannot eſcape, if finding your ſelf loſt and
undone, you will not preſently run to Chriſt, without firſt
finding in your ſelf Something that may ſeem to commend
you to him.</p>
            <p>2. Such a Submiſſion ſeems Repugnant to God's revealed
Will: For, if this be the Will of God, even our ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
That we ſhould believe in His Son, and love Him with
our whole heart; Then it cannot be his Will, That we
ſhould be willing to Remain in an unſanctified eſtate, in
unbelief and enmity againſt Him; which are the inſeperable
Conjux of Willingneſs to be Seperated from God.</p>
            <p>3. Becauſe the promiſe of Eaſe and Reſt, is made to the
Weary and Laden, <hi>coming</hi> to Chriſt; Not to <hi>a Contentedneſs</hi>
to be divided from him. And the promiſe of Satisfaction,
is to your <hi>bungring and thirſting</hi> after Righteouſneſs; Not to
the <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſſation</hi> of your deſire, without the Thing which onely
can ſatiſfie.</p>
            <p>4. Becauſe, To be ſatisfied without obtaining Mercy, is
to be ſatisfied with an utter incapacity to Glorify the Grace
of God, and to enjoy Communion with Him; which are
the principal End and Duty of Men.</p>
            <p>5. It is Croſſe to the Genius and Concreated Principle of
the Reaſonable Creature; which is, to ſeek its own happineſs;
In any thing ſhort of which, it ought not to acquieſce.</p>
            <p>6. Such a ſubmiſſion cannot be Requiſite in Preparatory
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60927:15"/>
work<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe, That would ſuppoſe the higheſt pitch of
Grace attain'd (if yet it be a Grace, and attainable) before
you beleive; and conſequently, That it is not a Grace out
of Chriſt's fullneſs; for ye are ſuppoſed to have it before ye
go to Him.</p>
            <p>And therefore, when I ſay, ye muſt ſubmit without
Capitulating or making terms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> my meaning is, ye are not
to Treat upon terms of your own Making; Nor propound
any thing to God, but What Sovereign Mercy propounds
to you, as the Way and Means of obtaining your Great End:
And great Reaſon ye have for this Submiſſion; for herein
lies your Intereſt; Thoſe being (in truth) the onely Terms,
by which a loſt and ſinfull Creature can be rendred ſalvable,
or capable of being ſaved: (as may further appear in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel
of this diſcourſe.)</p>
            <p>I think (with humble Submiſſion) That if any Point of
time may be ſuppoſed before the Decree, It was <hi>Then</hi> that
<hi>Abſolute Dominion</hi> bor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </hi>
but <hi>Tranſferr'd: Before,</hi> it was in <hi>Power</hi> but <hi>Now</hi> in <hi>Grace:</hi>
In <hi>Grace,</hi> as touching the <hi>Elect;</hi> and in <hi>Juſtice,</hi> as touching

And all the <hi>Other,</hi> are (if <hi>I</hi> may ſo ſpeak) Subjects of <hi>This:</hi>
Even <hi>Chriſt Himſelf</hi> was made a <hi>Servant,</hi> to perform the

            <p>The Firſt is founded on that Infinite Bleſſedneſs which
the Moſt High God was poſſeſſed of in Himſelf,<note place="margin">Arg. I.</note> before the

to be <hi>Meetly</hi> Over-ruled, and their End <hi>attained,</hi> without
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60927:18"/>
doing wrong to any. The Motives by which Men are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced

            <p>1. To <hi>attain ſomething they have not;</hi> Ahab ſlew Naboth
for his vinyeard; 1 Kings 21. <hi>And Athaliah</hi> all the ſeed
Royal, to get the Throne; 2 Kings 11. Or,</p>
            <p>2. To <hi>Secure What they have:</hi> Pharaoh oppreſſed the
People, leſt growing Mighty, they ſhould ſhake off his yoke,
and get them out of his Service, <hi>Exodus</hi> 1. 10. <hi>Jeroboam</hi>
ſet up his Calves, to keep the people at home, and firm to
himſelf, 1 K. 12. 27, 28. And the Jews, they put Chriſt
to death, leſt the Romanes ſhould come, and take away
their Place and Nation; <hi>John</hi> 11. 48.</p>
            <p>Theſe two have ſhar'd the parentage of all the Oppreſſion
and Wrong-doing that have been in the World: Neither of
which is Compatible with our <hi>Great and Bleſſed God:</hi> For all
things are His already; He poſſeffeth the Heavens and the
Earth, and all the hoſts of them, with an <hi>Abſolute Power</hi> and
<hi>Right</hi> to <hi>diſpoſe</hi> them; And what can be added to That
which is Infinite? And as for <hi>Securing</hi> what He hath, Of
whom ſhould he be afraid? For (1.) <hi>There is no God

<hi>forth</hi> in His putting the Matter of our Duty into ſuch a Way
and Method, as renders it <hi>moſt Facile,</hi> and is <hi>moſtly conducible
to</hi> our <hi>Chief End: As</hi> 1 <hi>To Remember our Creator in the days
of our youth:</hi> For, the Work of Converſion and Turning
to God; muſt needs be much eaſier <hi>Then,</hi> than when <hi>habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated</hi>
in an evil courſe: For, Long impenitency (beſides

the provocation it is to God) eſtranges the Mind more
from Him; Makes the Spirit more Inflexible, and harder
to be wrought upon; It Multiplies our Work, and Subſtracts
our ſtrength: For One accuſtomed in evil, to learn to do
well; and for a Blackmoor to change his skin, are things of
a like poſſibility: It's a very Rare and Difficult thing for a
Man to be born again, when he is Old.</p>
            <p>2. To Watch againſt, and ſuppreſs the <hi>firſt motions</hi> of
ſin; and to avoid what ever might be an <hi>Occaſion,</hi> or have
Tendency <hi>towards</hi> it:<note place="margin">Mal. 2 15.</note> and in order thereto, To <hi>take heed

from all appearance of evil;</hi> to hate the garment ſpotted

did: (For, the profeſſed practiſe of ſome Saints, is <hi>Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive</hi>
to Others, and Equivalent to a Command.) To keep an
Enemy from Riſing, is much eaſier than to Quell him being
up; yea, To Nip ſin when 'tis young, is the ready way,
Not only to <hi>keep it low,</hi> but to <hi>kill</hi> it; as the continual pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            <p>3.<note place="margin">Ro. 14. 23.</note> Not to do any thing, the lawfulneſs whereof is <hi>dubious</hi>

an occaſion of ſin to Others, whereof we cannot be Guiltleſs:
So likewiſe,<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 5 19.</note> to Cheriſh all Motions to Good; Not to quench

God will ſpeak:<note place="margin">Exod. 15. 26. 1 K. 19. 12.</note> Who oft times delivers His Mind with a
<hi>Still</hi> and <hi>a ſmall</hi> voice; which doubly obligeth our Attention.</p>
            <p>4. In His preſſing with ſo much weight and Neceſſity,
thoſe great Duties of Faith, Love, Patience, Self-denial, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
(1) <hi>Faith,</hi> which conſiſts in Submitting to the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of God; Taking hold of His ſtrength; and Following
the conduct of His Wiſdom: And in order thereto, ſhewing
us our own ſinfulneſs, weakneſs, and folly; with the vanity
of all Created Bottoms, which have always failed at the
greateſt need; and ſo, drawing our hearts to lean on Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
In whom alone we have Righteouſneſs and ſtrength.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:60927:20"/>
(2) <hi>Love;</hi> This is a powerfull, Active, Candid, and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeing
Principle; It <hi>bears all things; Thinks no evil; Takes
all in good part;</hi> Makes <hi>That</hi> both portable and pleaſant,
which without Love would be both harſh and burdenſom.</p>
            <p>(3) <hi>Patience,</hi> and <hi>Meekneſs of Spirit:</hi> Theſe mitigate the
Dolour of any ſuffering;<note place="margin">Judges 8. 3.</note> and often prevent or allay the ſtorm
that is riſing: <hi>A ſoft Anſwer turns away wrath, Prov.</hi> 15. 1.</p>
            <p>It alſo breeds Experience; 1. That any affliction may be
born, through Him that ſtrengthens: 2. That afflictions are all
for our profit: 3. That we could not well have been without
them: 4. It alſo gives to underſtand the Lords meaning in
them, which the Noiſe of tumultuating paſſions would drown
to us: And, as a Means to work this Patience, the Lord ſets
before us, 1. That there is <hi>a Cauſe</hi> of every Chaſtening; and
<hi>that</hi> cauſe is from our ſelves; and therefore, no cauſe to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain:
2. That He afflicts not willingly; Onely when
there is Need, and no more than Needs muſt: 3. That He
hath many Gracious Ends in afflicting;<note place="margin">1 Pet. 16.</note> As (1) To humble

through them: Which Greater, had they come <hi>afore,</hi> might
have Overturned us.</p>
            <p>(4.) <hi>Self-denial:</hi> This is a duty of <hi>neereſt</hi> concernment to
us, ſince we have no ſuch enemies as ſelf-love, and fleſhly luſts,
to warr againſt our ſouls. Theſe things conſidered will
ſhew, that <hi>David's</hi> Concluſion is Right and Genvine; <hi>Good
and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright is the Lord, therefore will He teach Sinners in the
way:</hi> Even Reaſon it ſelf might tell us (to be ſure, <hi>Sanctified</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, Let this Doctrine for ever vindicate the holy
and good wayes of God, (both Thoſe he walks in towards
us, and thoſe He commands us to walk in towards Him)
from all thoſe ſenſeleſs Imputations of <hi>Harſhneſs, Moroſeneſs,
Nicety, Preciſeneſs,</hi> or what ever elſe the prophaneneſs or
Ignorance of Men can tax them with: For: as it is ſaid, ſo
it is found, by the certain and fober experience of all that
fear Him, and (againſt ſuch experience, no Reaſoning is to
be admitted) I ſay, 'tis a General Infallible Experiment,
That <hi>all the wayes of Wiſdom are pleaſantneſs to him that
walks in them:</hi> which argues, That thoſe who think other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
are ignorant of them; and therefore not competent
Judges. 'Tis granted, indeed, That thoſe whoſe hearts are
in theſe good wayes of God, have their ſteps too often
<hi>turn'd aſide,</hi> and go <hi>haltingly</hi> in them: But in Truth, the
Fault is not in the <hi>Way,</hi> but in the <hi>Men:</hi> There is ſome Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
in their bones, or diſlocation of Joynts; Something
is out of order. A Creeple will limp in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Porch,

The Law and our hearts were once at perfect agreement;
the diſcord came in by our voluntary ſwerving from our firſt
Make. Therefore, admit not the leaſt Motion, that looks
but <hi>awry</hi> on the Commands or Diſpoſements of God; but
Juſtifie them to the height, and take ſhame to your ſelf, as <hi>Paul</hi>

                  <p>Thirdly, If the Lord cannot but do Right, Then let us
all take heed of ſin, which the Holineſs and Juſtice of God are
ſo inexorably bent againſt, He will not Pardon without ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction:
Yea, Beware of <hi>Little</hi> Sins, (Little, I mean, in
eſteem with Men, or in compariſon of ſome others) Your
Nearneſs to God will not excuſe you: <hi>You have I known
[therefore] you will I puniſh:</hi>

yet the Lord would not hear him; <hi>Speak no more to Me
of this Matter.</hi> To make light of the leaſt ſin becauſe Grace
abounds, is to ſin againſt your own ſoule; and to make the
precious blood of Chriſt a Common thing; (the <hi>leaſt</hi> is the
price of blood) Although He love thee, and that ſo, as <hi>Never</hi>
to take His loving kindneſs from thee; yet He will not let thee
go altogether unpuniſhed: Yea, the Lord may hide from thee
the ſenſe of His love, and Make thee feel His, <hi>diſpleaſure</hi> even
to the breaking of thy bones, &amp;c. For, He muſt diſcountenance
ſin; and that for our good, aſwell as to Vindicate the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

            <p>
               <hi>Abraham</hi> was pitch'd upon, to be the Root and Father
of God's peculiar people; Whom He would Own and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

<hi>All Families of the Earth ſhould be bleſſed:</hi> Which contains a

to prefer him above the Reſt of his Kindred? Was <hi>he</hi> any

the Lord <hi>ſingled</hi> him forth and called him <hi>alone.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 51. 2.</note> And, in
truth, no other Reaſon can be given for it, than what is

for any natural fruitfulneſs in them above others: For,
<hi>Abraham</hi>'s body was now dead; And <hi>Sarah,</hi> beſides her
Natural barrenneſs, was paſt the age of Child bearing;
which occaſioned her to laugh at the promiſe: For who
(indeed) would make choice of a dry'd Stock and a barren Soil
to begin his Nurſery with? In ſuch materials is nothing to
induce to it.</p>
            <p>The ſame courſe He was pleaſed to take with <hi>Abrahams</hi>

            <p>But let be obſerved, It was not <hi>Jacob</hi>'s more worthy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour,
whether <hi>foreſeen</hi> or <hi>acted,</hi> that procured him the

He <hi>hunted</hi> for Veniſon,<note place="margin">Gen. 27 5. 31. 43.</note> and for <hi>true</hi> Veniſon; ſuch as his Father
loved; which he alſo makes ready, and brings with ſpeed, big

<hi>with tears and hitter crying.</hi>
            </p>

               <item>3. He abuſeth his Father with counterfeit Veniſon.</item>

               <item>5. He ſeeks it by fraud and down-right lying: He

            </list>
            <p>It need not be ask'd, which of the Two's deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

behaves himſelf dutifully to obtain, is diſmiſt without it:
And though his Father bleſſed <hi>Jacob</hi> unwittingly, and by

'tis wonderfull to obſerve, how God ordered the Series and

employment was to keep the ſhéep; His exerciſe, what
was it, but ſuch as is reckon'd effeminate? He addicted
himſelf to Muſick: ſee alſo his Complexion or Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of body, White and Ruddy; no promiſing cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of a Martial Spirit: And yet this Man (or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
this lad and ſtripling) thus qualified and thus educated,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60927:28"/>
he muſt be the Captain of the Lord's hoſt; who yet had the
greateſt enemies to deal with; and therefore had need of a
Man of courage and conduct to be over them. Well! let
<hi>David</hi>'s birth, complexion, employment, education, be what
it will; Never ſo unlikely in all humane reſpects; yet, this
<hi>David is,</hi> and he <hi>muſt</hi> be the man, whom the Lord will ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
to Rule his people, to fight their battels, and to do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits.
In this choice, the Lord was pleaſed to ſet-by what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is taking with men; <hi>He ſeeth not as Man ſeeth,</hi> i. e;
He regards not Men for their Natural accompliſhments:
If for any thing, it muſt be (probably) for ſome excellent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowment
of the <hi>Mind;</hi> and that of <hi>Wiſdome</hi> is of as weighty
conſideration in the choice of a Prince, as any other: But
this is no Inducement or Motive to God; <hi>He reſpects not any
that are wiſe of heart:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 37. 24.</note> And if He did, it Was not here to be
had; <hi>David</hi> had no Prince-like qualities above his brethren,
until afterwards: Which thing is plainly intimated in the

upon Him [from that day forward.</hi>]</p>
            <p>Then for <hi>Jeremy,</hi> The Lord ordains him to be a Prophet;
ſets him over Nations and Kingdoms; commiſſionates him
to Root out and pull down; To build and to plant: <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Why? what had <hi>Jeremy</hi> done, that the Lord ſhould call
him to ſo Imperial a work? Sure, no great matter; for this
he was ordained to, before he was born; <hi>Before I formed thee
in the belly I knew thee;</hi> I <hi>ſanctified thee and ordained thee a
Prophet:</hi> Jer. 1. 5. It alſo appears by his own Confeſſion, how
unmeet he was for ſuch a work, and how unwilling; <hi>I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

That the great God ſhould do him this honour? He did not
ſo much as know the Lord; which alſo is twice repeated, as
a matter worthy our obſervation.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>Paul;</hi> The Lord from Heaven commiſſionates him
His <hi>Preacher General</hi> among the Gentiles; to bear His Name
before Kings; To Mawl and Ranſack the devil's kingdom; and
to turn the World upſide-down; (Witneſs his doings at
<hi>Epheſus, Athens,</hi> and other places:) And this he was called
to, even whiles in the heat of his perſecuting fury againſt
that Name, which now he is ſent to preach: And that there
was no motive on <hi>Paul's</hi> part, himſelf is witneſs, where
ſpeaking of that his Call, he aſcribes it to the pleaſure and
power of God, as much as he doth his natural birth,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 15.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> might alſo bring in the Stories of <hi>Sampſon, Joſiah,

would fail.</p>
            <p>Now, Theſe inſtances may not be valued as Hiſtorical
Relations onely; (that would be too narrow a meaning for
them) but according to the Scripture-way of inferring and
improving to ſpiritual Uſes; and ſo, they will be a good
Preparatory proof of the buſineſs in hand: For, if there be

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Election</hi> is the great <hi>Fundamental Inſtitute</hi> of the Goſpel;
It is <hi>That,</hi> which in humane States is call'd the <hi>Supream
Law,</hi> which is both <hi>Irreverſible</hi> in it ſelf, and requires that
all <hi>inferiour</hi> adminiſtrations be <hi>accommoded</hi> thereto: So, the

<hi>All;</hi> that the great <hi>End</hi> of all might remain <hi>infru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis granted true, That the beſt-founded States upon

their thoughts periſh: Their minds may alter, and depart

Humane affairs are expoſed to a Thouſand Incidents,
which humane prudence can neither prevent nor provide

               <p>But it is not ſo with God, No Event can be new to Him;
<hi>He declares the end from the beginning:</hi> His Judgement and
Purpoſe cannot alter; <hi>He is of one mind, and who can turn

And this may be one Reaſon, why Election is ſo often af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
to be <hi>From the beginning,</hi> and <hi>From the Foundation
of the World; viz.</hi> to ſhew, That whatever ſhould be in time,
ſhould be <hi>ſubordinate</hi> to <hi>Election;</hi> which is all one as to make
it <hi>Abſolute.</hi>
               </p>

The Law ſhews our duty, but gives not wherewith to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form

               <p>All under the Covenant of Works, are <hi>without God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

               <p>

                  <note place="margin">Arg. 3.</note> becauſe by <hi>ſuch</hi> an Election
only can Salvation be <hi>Inſur'd. This</hi> bottom <hi>Adam</hi> had not in
his Primitive State; He was <hi>made</hi> upright, but his <hi>Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
that ſtate, was hung upon his well-uſing of what he had,
without any additional help, beſides his original Stock. In
him may be ſeen the <hi>utmoſt</hi> that <hi>created</hi> Grace, of it ſelf, can
do; even in a ſtate of <hi>Perfection:</hi> Unto which being left,
How ſoon did he degenerate and come to Ruin! And all his
Poſterity would have run the ſame courſe, if placed in his
ſtead; as we know they have done (One by One) Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
all the helps, which are given in common, unto men.
And 'tis no wonder, Since <hi>Now</hi> they have ſo ſtrong a Bias
to evil, which <hi>Adam</hi> had not. And if there be any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
caſt in, (which ſome do affirm, and call it The <hi>New</hi>
Covenant) the more is our Doctrine confirm'd: For, the
more helps they have, if yet they fall ſhort; (as they do)
the more evident it is, That nothing ſhort of <hi>ſuch</hi> an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
will ſecure them. An Example of this we have in the
Old World; who, by all their Natural Ingenioſity, and long
lives to improve it, together with <hi>Noah's</hi> ſixſcore years prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
and the Spirits ſtriving; were not led unto God;
but ſtill grew from bad to worſe, until <hi>all</hi> the imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of their hearts were <hi>only</hi> evil,<note place="margin">Gen. 6. 5.</note> and that <hi>continually.</hi> And

               </p>
               <p>It is True, That <hi>Noah</hi> was found Righteous; and as true
it is, That <hi>Election</hi> was it that made him ſo, as <hi>ver. 8, But</hi>

               <p>It may alſo be ſeen in the people of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> who, over and

                  <hi>as with them;</hi> And yet, the <hi>Generality</hi> of them
ſo bad, <hi>That they juſtified their Siſter</hi> Sodom.</p>
               <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> Covenant thus failing; ſuch was the Grace of
our Lord, (foreſeeing it) as to determine of a <hi>ſecond,</hi> or
<hi>New</hi> Covenant; by which He would <hi>fix</hi> and <hi>ſecure</hi> a Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and that <hi>Infallibly:</hi> And hence it is termed, The <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant

And <hi>theſe</hi> are thoſe <hi>ſure mercies of David,</hi> recorded in the

Election,<note place="margin">Arg. 4.</note> as of <hi>Chriſt's.</hi> That Man or humane Body, which
the ſecond Perſon was to Aſſume and Unite to Himſelf, was
not Ordain'd to that Union, upon any Condition whatever,
as (namely) If He ſhould fullfil all Righteouſneſs, Deſtroy
the Devil, diſſolve his works, and make Attonement for ſin:
For theſe He could never have done without that Union:
And that His Ordination thereto was <hi>Abſolute,</hi> appears by
<hi>Heb. 10, 5, A Body haſt Thou prepared Me;</hi> And Luke 1. 35,
<hi>That Holy Thing which ſhall be born of thee, ſhall be called the
Son of God.</hi> Matth. 1. 21, <hi>He ſhall ſave His people from their

<hi>that</hi> Man's being United to the Son of God, is evidently
ſet forth. And, That <hi>our</hi> Election, (as to this Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance

                  <hi>V.</hi> It was neceſſary That Election ſhould be <hi>Abſolute</hi>

                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 19, 20</note>
And all that were ſaved before He ſuffered, were ſaved on
the Credit of that Decree. The Scripture alſo tells you
plainly,<note place="margin">Rev. 13. 8.</note> That <hi>He was the Lamb ſlain from the foundation of

                  <note place="margin">Math. 26 39, 42.</note> and that it was <hi>not poſſible</hi> That Cup ſhould

of <hi>Men,</hi> to lay down the price without ſecuring the
Purchaſe: Then ſurely, the Wiſdom of <hi>God</hi> would never
determine the death of His Son, for Men's Salvation, and
leave the Salvation of thoſe very Men at an uncertainty;

of <hi>Election;</hi> Nor was this Election (as ſome ſpeak) a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
to Elect ſuch as ſhould happen to be <hi>thus</hi> and <hi>ſo</hi>
qualified: But, Certain <hi>Determinate Perſons</hi> were Choſen
by <hi>Name,</hi> or <hi>ſingled out</hi> from among the <hi>Reſt,</hi> and ordain'd
to Eternal life. Our Saviour ſtiles them <hi>The Men that were
given Him [out] of the World,</hi> John 17. 6. And they were
Given Him by <hi>Name</hi> (as well as number) and by <hi>thoſe</hi>
Names He knows them, <hi>John</hi> 10, 3, and 14. And that this
<hi>Election</hi> was tranſacted <hi>from Eternity,</hi> is evident, John 17. 23.
with <hi>ver. 24. Eph. 1. 4. Rev.</hi> 13. 8. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. 8. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Theſe may be Argued,</p>
               <p>I. From the Example of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Election:<note place="margin">Arg. 1.</note> It was not a
perſon <hi>uncertain,</hi> that was to be <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Chriſt;</hi> but, the
Second Perſon in Humane Nature: And this Capacity He ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain'd
from <hi>Everlaſting.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pro. 8. 23. 31.</note> Nor was it <hi>Any</hi> Body, which He
might aſſume,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 19, 20.</note> but that very ſame numerical Body, that was
prepared for Him; <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 5. with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. 7. And this
very Perſon He loved before the foundation of the World,
<hi>John</hi> 17. 24.</p>
               <p>It is worthy Obſervation, how <hi>particular</hi> the Decree was,
even in things <hi>Circumſtantial</hi> to our Lord Chriſt; As that
He ſhould come of <hi>Abraham's</hi> Stock, of <hi>Judah's</hi> Tribe, of
<hi>David</hi>'s Lineage, Be conceived in a Virgin, Born at <hi>Bethlem,</hi>
and this, when the Sceptre was departing from <hi>Iudah;</hi>
That He ſhould be Buffeted, Scourged, Spit-upon, hanged
on a Tree; His hands and His fect pierced; That gall and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar
ſhould be given Him to drink; That a bone of Him
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60927:33"/>
ſhould not be broken; (even whiles on both ſides of Him,
they were) That His Garments ſhould be parted, and lots
caſt on His Veſture; As alſo, That He ſhould riſe again the
third day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that theſe were <hi>all Decreed,</hi> appears by
the Propheſies of them; which are the Decree <hi>exemplified</hi> (or
Drawn out of the Regiſter.) As touching His Reſurrection,
It is ſaid Expreſly,<note place="margin">Pſ 2. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>I will declare the Decree:</hi> And the ſame is
as true of all the Reſt.</p>
               <p>And if the Election of the Head was <hi>Perſonal</hi> and <hi>from
Eternity;</hi> why not theirs that ſhould make up His Body,
ſince <hi>They</hi> did as really exiſt <hi>Then,</hi> as the <hi>Humane Nature</hi> of
Chriſt did? Beſides, it was very agreeable, That He and
They ſhould both be appointed <hi>together;</hi> For, He could not
be an <hi>Head,</hi> but with reſpect to a <hi>Body:</hi> And that they were
expreſly Determin'd of, appears by 139 <hi>Pſa. v. 16. In thy
book were all my Members written, when as yet there was none
of them.</hi> If any ſay, That was meant of <hi>David</hi>'s Members?
I anſwer, That if God thought the Members of an <hi>Earthly</hi>
body worthy His Regiſtring; He could not be leſs particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
and Exact, about the Myſtical Body of His <hi>Son:</hi> Beſides,
<hi>David</hi> was His Type.</p>
               <p>Chriſt alſo was Ordain'd to be a <hi>Saviour,</hi> and that by His
<hi>death;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 20.</note> and both <hi>from the foundation of the World:</hi> It was
therefore expedient, <hi>Then</hi> alſo to be Determined, How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and <hi>who</hi> in <hi>particular,</hi> ſhould have Salvation by Him:
He was not To die for Himſelf, but for thoſe, whoſe ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
He undertook. Now, it is not a thing proper, to ſpeak
of <hi>Security</hi> or <hi>Bail,</hi> but with reſpect to a <hi>Debtor</hi> or <hi>Offender;</hi>
And <hi>that</hi> Debtor or Offender muſt be <hi>known</hi> too, and <hi>Named;</hi>
Or elſe, the entring of Bail is an Inſignificant Act; eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
where the Surety hath no debt or default of his own to
be charged with. Our Lord and Saviour did not offer
Himſelf (if I may ſo ſpeak) for <hi>ſome bodie's</hi> ſins, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
<hi>whoſe: Aaron</hi> knew Whoſe Treſpaſſes he offer'd for;
Their <hi>Names</hi> were graven on his breaſt-plate: Not their <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional</hi>
Name, (<hi>viz. Iſraelite</hi> or <hi>Believer</hi>) but their <hi>Perſonal</hi> Names,
<hi>Reuben, Simeon, Levi,</hi>—So had our Great High Prieſt, or
He could not have made attonement for us: And that place
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60927:34"/>
(<hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 8.) points at the <hi>ſame</hi> time for <hi>both;</hi> Thoſe
words [<hi>From the foundation of the World</hi>] do refer as well
to the writing of their Names in the Book of life, as to the
Lamb's being ſlain. And if it be ſaid, It muſt referr to that
as was <hi>laſt</hi> named; then let <hi>ver.</hi> 8. of the 17. <hi>Chap.</hi> ſpeak
for it; where, deciphering thoſe who ſhall wonder after
the beaſt, he ſayes they are ſuch whoſe <hi>Names were not written
in the hook of life, from the foundation of the World:</hi> what can
be more expreſs!</p>
               <p>II. The Deſign of God in the death of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Arg. 2.</note> could not
otherwiſe be ſecur'd. Had the deſign been, To Purchaſe Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
for <hi>Believers,</hi> without aſcertaining the <hi>Perſons</hi> that
ſhould believe; it had been uncertain, Whether <hi>any</hi>
ſhould be <hi>ſaved,</hi> becauſe uncertain Whether <hi>any</hi> would <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.
If Certain,</hi> That ſome would believe; This Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
muſt be <hi>Decreed;</hi> (For Nothing future, could be certain
Otherwiſe.) And if it was Decreed, That <hi>Some</hi> ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve;
The <hi>Individuals</hi> of that [<hi>Some</hi>] muſt be Decreed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo:
For, Faith is the Gift of God; and could not be fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen
in <hi>any,</hi> but whom He had Decreed to give it unto.
Which laid together are a good demonſtration, That thoſe
Chriſt ſhould die for, were as well Pre-ordain'd, as That
He ſhould die for them, and that <hi>definitely</hi> and by
<hi>Name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>III.</hi> It may further be Argued,<note place="margin">Arg. 3.</note> from the Fathers <hi>preparing
a kingdom from the foundation of the World,</hi> and Manſions, or
Places in it.</p>
               <p>To prepare the way of this Argument; Conſider the
<hi>Punctuality</hi> of God's diſpoſements in things of a <hi>Lower</hi>
Moment: He did not Create the Earth in vain; (<hi>i. e.</hi> To
ſtand empty and void, as at its firſt formation) Nor the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
quarters thereof to be Inhabited <hi>indefinitely,</hi> by ſome
Nation or Other, who ſhould happen to get poſſeſſion of
them: But <hi>He divided to the Nations their inheritance and the
bounds of their Habitation:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 32. 8.</note> Mount <hi>Seir</hi> was given to <hi>Eſau,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts. 17. 26.</note>
and <hi>Ar</hi> to the Children of <hi>Lot: Each</hi> Nation had its li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60927:34"/>
ſtaked out,<note place="margin">Deut. 2. 5, 9.</note> and this <hi>from the dayes of old.</hi> And if we
may diſtinguiſh of <hi>Acts</hi> in God, and of <hi>Time</hi> in Eternity;
His Purpoſe to <hi>firm</hi> and <hi>bring forth thoſe</hi> Nations, muſt needs
be as early, as to Create and furniſh thoſe parts of the World
which they ſhould Inhabit.</p>
               <p>Now, <hi>Earthly</hi> Settlements being of trivial Moment to
the <hi>Heavenly</hi> Manſions; it ſeems a good Conſequent, That
if yet, particular Nations were fore-appointed for particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Provinces on Earth; Much more ſhould particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
be deſign'd for those particular Manſions in Heaven:
And, if either were appointed afore the other; It muſt be
the <hi>Perſons:</hi> For, <hi>the Sabbath was made for Man, and not Man
for the Sabbath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Domeſtiques of God's Houſe or Place of Glory, are
a ſacred State and Order of <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Prieſts;</hi> and Each in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual

The Twelve Apoſtles ſhall have their Twelve
Thrones, and every One his Own: This is evident by our

                  <hi>To ſit
on my right hand and on my left, is not Mine to give; but it ſhall
he given to them for [whom] it is prepared of my Father:</hi> If
for Believers <hi>indefinitely,</hi> why not for theſe two Brethren as
ſoon as any other: eſpecially ſince they firſt made requeſt for
them? The Truth is, thoſe <hi>Places</hi> were not <hi>now</hi> to be diſpoſed
of; it was determined, <hi>who</hi> ſhould have them, long before;
even <hi>From the foundation of the World.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matt. 25. 35.</note> The ſcope of this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
was not to ſhew, That the places requeſted for, were
prepar'd for <hi>Believers;</hi> (for theſe were Believers who made
requeſt for them) but that they were Appointed for Certain
<hi>particular</hi> Perſons, <hi>and</hi> they muſt have them.</p>
               <p>Much might be added, in confirmation of theſe two bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
But, by theſe <hi>I</hi> hope, it is clear, That Election is <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal</hi>

               <p>It was requiſite, the New Covenant ſhould have an Head

Chriſt and He are ſet forth as Parallels, in <hi>Romans</hi> 3. from
<hi>ver</hi> 12. to 21.</p>
               <p>The benefits which the Elect are Choſen unto, they
are made partakers of by their Union with Chriſt; He is
the Root in whom the <hi>Fulneſs</hi> dwels: Not only the <hi>Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
on which the Church is built; but the <hi>Rock</hi> which affords
all the Spiritual Materials of the Heavenly Temple; Even the

in themſelves, the whole of that Principle, which
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60927:35"/>
would have lead them to God, as their life and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs:
And had (withal) contracted ſuch an Eumity

to Him; (And this Gulph was ſo fixed) as would for
ever have kept God and us aſunder; had not that bleſſed
Project of <hi>Chooſing in Chriſt</hi> been ſet on foot to diſſolve it.
It could not be done by any Created Power; Nor could
Creatures ſo much as propound a Way for it: And if
they could, who durſt ſo harden himſelf, as to Mention the
Thing, which onely could do it! But, The Great God,
bleſſed for ever, He findes out a way for it: And the
ſame Love that ordain'd to Eternal life, would alſo put it
in <hi>ſuch</hi> a way, as ſhould ſurely take effect: And to this end,
(<hi>viz.</hi> That Thoſe Ordain'd to Salvation, might be both
Rightfully <hi>entituled</hi> to that Salvation, and <hi>ſucceſſefully</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Ground,</hi> or <hi>Moving Cauſe</hi> of <hi>God</hi>'s Election, is quite
different from the manner of Men; who commonly pitch
upon things, for ſome <hi>Natural Aptneſs,</hi> or <hi>Meetneſs</hi> of them
for their Work: They will not take a knotty, croſs-grain'd,
or wind-ſhaken piece of Timber, to make a Pillar of State:
But, the Lord pitches upon ſuch (and ſuch to chooſe) the
<hi>poor, baſe, weak, fooliſh,</hi> things of the world; the worſt of
Men, and <hi>chief of Sinners:</hi> (The inſtances of <hi>Paul, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſeh,
Mary Magdalen,</hi> and others, make it evident:) and
of theſe, He is pleaſed to make Pillars for the Houſe of God;
(Pilluis of State indeed!) whereon to write His own Name,
to manifeſt thereby His Sovereignty, Holineſs, Wiſdome,
Power, Righteouſneſs, and Free Grace to Eternity.</p>

The Lord's way and method, in bringing His Sons to
Glory; is the beſt Demonſtration of the Right order of
Cauſes: For, though there be a Concurrence of many things,

Order, they will ſtill lead us up to the <hi>Goad Pleaſure of God,

Grace and Works are <hi>Inconſiſtent</hi> in the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of ſalvation.
The ſcripture is every Cautelous of admitting <hi>any</hi> thing as a

be a Thing that doth alway <hi>accompany</hi> Grace, and <hi>That</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which a Man cannot be Saved: The Apoſtle puts them
in oppoſition, and is very intent on the Argument, as a thing
of great Moment, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. Where, firſt he ſhews,
That amidſt that general Defection of the Iewiſh Nation,
there ſtill was a Remnant whom God had Reſerv'd: <hi>Theſe</hi>
he terms, <hi>The Foreknown, ver</hi> 2. and in the 7. <hi>ver.</hi> he
calls them plainly, <hi>The Election:</hi> And then, leſt any ſhould aſcribe
it to a falſe cauſe, (as in that paralel Caſe he reſembles it to,)
viz, That <hi>they had not bowed the knee to Baal;</hi> but ſtuck to
the True Religion, when others fell off; he tells us, No;
Their Election was founded upon <hi>Grace:</hi> And as for <hi>Works</hi>
they had no place in the <hi>Cauſality</hi> of it. By <hi>Grace</hi> he means,
the Free Favour of God; who is not moved by any thing
without Himſelf; But what He does, He does it Freely;
without reſpect to Mens deſert; Nay, their <hi>

no more Grace;</hi> For, <hi>to him that worketh, is the Reward not
reckoned of Grace, but of Debt;</hi> Rom. 4. 4. <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi>
are well agreed: Theſe both have the <hi>ſame ſcope</hi> and <hi>end:</hi>
But,<note place="margin">Rom. 4. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Works</hi> have always Claſh'd: The <hi>ſetting up</hi>
of the One, is the <hi>depoſing</hi> of the other: Either the Ark
muſt Out, or <hi>Dagon</hi> down; One Temple cannot hold
them both. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 28.</p>
               <p>To the ſame effect is the drift of that diſcourſe in <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.
It appears from <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 1. That ſome there were, who
taught a Neceſſity of Circumciſion; as without which they
could not be ſaved: Pretty willing they were to admit of
Chriſt, ſo they might joyn Circumciſion with Him, and
keeping the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> But, this dangerous daubing
with things unmixable, our holy Apoſtle could not brook;
both as reflecting on the honour of his Maſter, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
their <hi>onely</hi> Foundation: And therefore, to keep
them from or bring them off, that perillous Quick-ſand;
he tells them expreſly, Theſe two cannot ſtand together in
that matter: For, if they be <hi>Circumciſed, they are Debtors to
the whole Law;</hi> and <hi>Chriſt is become of none effect to them;</hi>
becauſe <hi>they are fallen from Grace.</hi> It is, as if he had ſaid, If
you take in any part, though never ſo little of Legal Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervances,
as <hi>Neceſſary</hi> to your being Juſtified, ye forfeit the
whole benefit of Goſpel-Grace. The Grace of Chriſt is
ſufficient for you; He is a Saviour Compleat in Himſelf;
and if you look (though but a ſquint) at <hi>any thing elſe;</hi> it is
a Renouncing of <hi>Him:</hi> He will be Saviour <hi>altogether</hi> or
<hi>not at all.</hi> And therefore he tells them again, and that with
a kind of vehemency;<note place="margin">Gall. 5. 2.</note> That <hi>if they be Circumciſed, Chriſt
ſhall profit them Nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as a Man may not put in his Claim for Juſtification
on accompt of his <hi>Works;</hi> ſo neither of his <hi>Faith,</hi> as if <hi>That</hi>

Faith it ſelf, as it is the Believers Act, comes under the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a Work. Let us therefore Conſider, What part it
is that Faith holds in this Matter? leaſt whiles we caſt out
Works, as not ſtanding with Grace; we make a Work of
Faith. It is Faith's Office, to make the Soul live wholly on
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:60927:39"/>
Another; and to Renounce Self-<hi>ability,</hi> as much as Self-<hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert:</hi>
To apprehend that Righteouſneſs by which Grace Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies;
Not onely to be Justified thereby upon your Believing;
but to work in you even that Faith, by which you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
it;<note place="margin">Iſa. 45. 24.</note> anſwerable to that of the Prophet, <hi>In the
Lord have I Righteouſneſs and Strength.</hi> He that will be Saved
muſt come as an <hi>ungodly</hi> Perſon to be juſtified <hi>freely</hi> by
the Grace of God: He muſt reckon himſelf an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodly</hi>
Man, to the very <hi>inſtant</hi> of his Juſtification. True it is, The
Juſt ſhall live by Faith; but 'tis alſo true, That it is not
<hi>their own Faith,</hi> or act of believing, that they live by, (though
not without it:) Which alſo ſeems the Apoſtle's meaning,
where he ſayes, <hi>The life, which I now live, I live by the Faith
of the Son of God:</hi> Where note, That as Faith is the life of
a Believer; ſo Chriſt is the life of his Faith; <hi>I live</hi> (ſaith he)
<hi>yet not I but Chriſt liveth in Me:</hi> Chriſt was his life; and he
lived on Chriſt, by virtue of Chriſt's living in him.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding all which, it is evidently true, and muſt
conſtantly be affirm'd, That <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Works</hi> will ſtill be <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether</hi>
in the way of Salvation; (the one doth not extinguiſh
or exclude the other) Only not as <hi>Collegues</hi> or <hi>Joint-Cauſers</hi>
thereof: But rather as a <hi>Workman,</hi> and his <hi>Tooles,</hi> which
himſelf firſt makes, and then workes with them; By <hi>Grace
ye are ſaved through Faith;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 8.</note> and <hi>that not of your ſelves, it is the
Gift of God:</hi> Even this believing or Acting faculty is a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Grace's raiſing up; and therefore, in the <hi>Throne</hi> 'tis
meet that Grace ſhould be above it. Works (therefore) how
good ſoever, are not the Cauſe of <hi>Salvation;</hi> and if ſo, then
not the cauſe of <hi>Election;</hi> for <hi>This</hi> (indeed) is the Cauſe of

it is,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 12.</note> that God's love to Men is ſo highly celebrated, in
1 <hi>Joh. 4. 10, [Herein] is love; Not that we loved God, but
that God loved us.</hi> And, <hi>Behold what manner of love the
Father hath beſtowed up on us!</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 1.</note> Which ſurely then is
not after the manner of Men;<note place="margin">Matth. 6. 46.</note> For, even <hi>Publicans</hi> do
ſo;<note place="margin">Luke. 6 32, 35.</note> and <hi>Sinners</hi> love thoſe that love them: But, to love
Enemies, and <hi>whiles</hi> Enemies; (as to love a Woman, (a

to His Choſen.</p>
               <p>But, Notwithſtanding theſe Scriptures (with others) ſeem
purpoſely written to obviate ſuch conceptions as would
feign our loving of God, to be the ground and Motive of His
love to us: Yet, great endeavours there are to Father
Election upon <hi>foreſeen faith and works,</hi> which That <hi>They</hi>
call the Covenant of Grace, has (they Say) qualified and
capacitated all Men for; and which certain more <hi>pliant,
ingenuous,</hi> and <hi>induſtrious</hi> perſons (as they ſpeak) would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
unto, by the helps they have in common with other
Men: But, this pedigree of Election is excepted againſt
as being not rightly deduced: For,</p>
               <p>1. Men having (in <hi>Adam</hi>) deveſted themſelves of all
that was holy and good; the Lord could not fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee
in them any thing of <hi>Worth</hi> or <hi>Deſirableneſs,</hi> but
what Himſelf ſhould work in them <hi>Anew,</hi> and that of
<hi>pure</hi> Grace and favour: For, ſin and deformity could
not be motives of love; And, that the Elect (of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves)
were in no wiſe better than other Men, is evident
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60927:41"/>
by the Scriptures late-quoted; where the Holy Ghoſt

qualifications as <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Holineſs</hi> had been <hi>foreſeen,</hi> (and
ſo, <hi>imputable</hi> to them) the Spirit of Truth would not have
Rank'd them <hi>Even</hi> with the <hi>Children of wrath,</hi> as He doth,
Eph. 2. 3. But,</p>

                  <hi>Or whereby could they oblige Him?</hi> He reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth
not any that are wiſe of heart. If thou be Righteous,
what giveſt thou Him? <hi>And</hi> who hath prevented Me (<hi>ſays

               <p>Take <hi>Paul</hi> for an Inſtance: He walked up to the light he

But, that it was not <hi>this</hi> moved God to make him a <hi>Choſen</hi>

               <p>3. Faith <hi>follows</hi> Election: God reſpects the perſon
before his offering. (you'l ſay perhaps) <hi>Abel</hi> was reſpected
as a <hi>Believer,</hi> and his offering for his Faith? True, But
that Faith of his was not the <hi>primary cauſe</hi> of God's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting
him. If <hi>Abels</hi> Perſon had not been reſpected <hi>firſt,</hi>
he had never been a Believer: For, Faith is the <hi>work</hi> and <hi>gift</hi>
of God; and (according to the courſe of all judicious Agents)
he that will work, muſt firſt pitch on the <hi>Subject</hi> He will
work upon; and he that gives, on the perſon he will give
unto.<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 6.</note> Beſides,<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>Abel</hi> could do nothing <hi>before</hi> he Believed,
that might move God to give him Faith: therefore it could
not be <hi>Abel's foreſeen Faith</hi> that was the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of his Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
The Scripture ſpeaks often of <hi>iron-ſinew'd-Necks</hi> and
<hi>Brazen Brows;</hi> and of <hi>Men's being in their blood,</hi> when the
Lord ſaid <hi>They ſhould live:</hi> As alſo that God loved Jacob be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he had done any good thing: and that the Saints love
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:60927:41"/>
God becauſe He loved them firſt: But no-where of Foreſeen
Faith and Holineſs as the Cauſe and Ground of God's love
to Men.</p>
               <p>4. Faith and Holineſs are <hi>Middle</hi> things: They are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <hi>Foundation</hi> nor <hi>Top-ſtone</hi> of Election. They are to
Sovereign Grace, as Stalks and Branches are to a Root; by
which the Root conveyes its virtues into its principal fruit:
<hi>Epheſ. 2. 8, By Grace ye are ſaved [through] Faith:</hi> 2. Theſ.
2. 13, <hi>Choſen to Salvation [through] Sanctification of the
Spirit and belief of the Truth.</hi> They are no more the <hi>Cauſe</hi>
of Election, than the Means of an End are the firſt Cauſe of
Purpoſe: Nay, no more than <hi>Tatnai's</hi> propenſion to build
the Temple, and to provide Sacrifices for the God of Heaven,
was the Cauſe of <hi>Darius</hi> his Decree that thoſe things ſhould
be done, <hi>Ezra</hi> 5. and 6. <hi>Chapters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. If men be Predeſtinate to Faith and Holineſs, (as they
are) according to <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 38, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>9. and 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 2. Then
they were not ſeen to be ſuch <hi>before</hi> their Predeſtination: Or
if they were, then their Election (as to that particular)
would ſeem impertinent: There can no Rational account
be given, why Men <hi>foreſeen</hi> to be ſuch, ſhould be ſo ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
predeſtinate thereto. So likewiſe, If Salvation be the
inſeparable product of Faith and Holineſs, according to
<hi>John</hi> 5. 24, <hi>He that believeth [hath] everlaſting life, and
ſhall not come into condemnation:</hi> 1. Pet. 1. 9. <hi>Receiving the
End of your Faith, the Salvation of your Souls:</hi> Then, to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
to Salvation thoſe foreſeen to be ſo qualified, would ſeem
a thing both needleſs and inſignificant: It would look like the
ſending of Men where they would have gon of Themſelves.</p>
               <p>Such ſapleſs, irregular, and injudicious Notions are very
unworthy that Celebrious and for ever Adorable Act of
Predeſtination. And if duely weighed, would ſet us fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
off from the doctrine of Self-advancement, which ſtands
in ſo point-blank oppoſition to the Doctrine of God's Grace.</p>
               <p>V.<note place="margin">Arg. 5.</note> It could not ſtand with the wiſdom and Goodneſs of
God, to found the Salvation of His People on a <hi>failable</hi>

thing beſides <hi>His own Immutable Will:</hi> For, whatever it
was, that Election had <hi>being</hi> from, by that alſo it muſt be
<hi>maintain'd.</hi> What then would become of it, if built on that

                  <note place="margin">Moſ. 6. 4.</note> The
Creature's will, even whiles in a ſtate of perfection, was too
ſlight and fickle a thing to build this eternal weight upon:
And if Man at his <hi>beſt</hi> eſtate was vanity, how much more
<hi>afterwards,</hi> when ſo ſtrong a Bent to vanity came upon his
will!</p>
               <p>VI. Laſtly, To derive Election from <hi>any</hi> Root beſides
the <hi>Good pleaſure of God,</hi> is to fruſtrate the principal
End of <hi>Man</hi>'s Salvation, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Glory of God's Grace,</hi>
Epheſ. 1. 6. and Chap. 2. 7. This Attribute (of all the
Reſt) He will not have ecclipſed, nor intrench'd upon:
'Tis ſo <hi>Divinely</hi> ſacred, as not to admit the leaſt <hi>humane</hi>
touch. For which very cauſe, the Lord hath ſo contrived
that bleſſed deſign and Plot of His Glory, that <hi>all boaſting
is excluded: And no fleſh ſhall Glory in His preſeuce.</hi> But if
any thing in the Creature be intitled to the <hi>Cauſality</hi> of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
Fleſh will Glory; and inſtead of excluding Man's
Boaſting, <hi>Grace</hi> it ſelf will be excluded, (which is far from
a Glorifying of it) as is plain from, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> would here Reſolve a Quere or two, which ſome have
urged from the Scripture, As</p>
               <div n="1" type="query">
                  <head>1. How can this Doctrine ſtand with the [General] love

                  <p>In General; the <hi>literal</hi> ſenſe of words is not to be reſted

                  <p>1. Though the Doctrine of <hi>General Love</hi> will not ſtand

Salvation; as alſo, That the natural Import of Election, is,
To <hi>Chooſe One</hi> or <hi>more out of Many:</hi> Now <hi>this</hi> neceſſarily
implyes the <hi>Leaving</hi> of Some; and conſequently, The

                  <p>2. The Will of God cannot be reſiſted: What He
wills ſhall come to paſs, becauſe with His willing the
End, He Wills alſo the Means; and that ſuch as ſhall
compaſs His End: <hi>Iſa. 46. 10, My councel ſhall ſtand,
I will do all my pleaſure;</hi> i. e. <hi>What</hi> I pleaſe to <hi>will, That</hi>
I will have <hi>done.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. If the word [<hi>All</hi>] be here taken <hi>univerſally,</hi> it takes

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers</hi> as well as Others; as if God would have

of the benefits we have by Government: And to <hi>pray for
them;</hi> Not onely for their peaceable governing of us; but if

There is no degree nor ſtate of Men exempted from Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:

That God affords them Means proper and ſufficient for

and that's all the Promiſe intends; and if they improve them
not, the fault's their own: True, it is ſo, and they ſhall

All that God doth for Men in this point: He that Decreed

                  <p>As the Elect ſhall certainly be <hi>ſaved,</hi> and alſo <hi>prepared</hi> for

in <hi>ſuch</hi> manner, as beſt agreeth to His Own intent; and
which He will bleſs and make <hi>effectual</hi> for that End: As is
ſeen in His ſending <hi>Paul</hi> to certain places, where he muſt
<hi>preach</hi> and <hi>not hold his peace;</hi> Why? becauſe <hi>God had much
People in that City: i. e.</hi> Many of His Elect Ones were there;

Calling and Election ſure.</hi> But really, Remiſneſs in duty, is
the natural reſult of that Doctrine which teacheth, That a
Man poſſibly may loſe all he hath run-for at the laſt ſtep:
For, who will ſtrain and toil himſelf (as they term it) for an
uncertainty? And if there be any ſuch, who neglect their
duty, becauſe if Elected they are ſure to be ſaved; they give
but a ſorry evidence of their ſtate: And they are (common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
ſuch as moſt eagerly oppoſe the Doctrine of Election;
and not of thoſe who hold for it.</p>

                  <head>Such an Election as we contend againſt, we judge to
be moſt unworthy the moſt excellent Nature of God; and
to be at manifeſt defiance with His Wiſdom, Holineſs,
Mercy, Juſtice, &amp;c.</head>
                  <p>If the Election contended againſt, be ſuch as the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors

                  <p>But it is <hi>Abſolute</hi> Election, without reſpect to Mens <hi>Works,</hi>
that is ſtriven againſt: And for this, we ſay</p>
                  <p>1. Abſolute Election is no way <hi>contrary</hi> to the wiſdom of
God, but moſt <hi>conſonant</hi> thereto; For, how can it ſtand with
His Wiſdom, to <hi>determine</hi> the death of His Son for the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of Men; and leave it <hi>undetermin'd</hi> (and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>uncertain</hi>) whether any one perſon ſhall have Salvation
by it?</p>
                  <p>2. It is ſo far from being at manifeſt defiance with the
<hi>Mercy</hi> of God; that it is moſt congruous and ſuitable to the
very nature of it. To ſhew Mercy, is To open the heart to
one in diſtreſs; To love and do good to Enemies, whom he
might as juſtly have deſtroyed, and was no way oblig'd
to ſpare, much leſs to advance them: Nay, perhaps they
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:60927:48"/>
were deeplier involv'd in guilt than other Men, even the
<hi>Chief of ſinners:</hi> which is ſure the <hi>higheſt illuſtration</hi> of
Mercy, and farr from <hi>a manifeſt defiance</hi> with it.</p>
                  <p>3. It doth not oppoſe the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of God; For, to
whom is He Debtor, or can be? <hi>All</hi> had a ſtock in <hi>Adam;</hi>
and having loſt it by their own default, God is not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged

had need to try their ſpirits, whether they be of God,

to the Grace of God, that He called <hi>Abraham alone;</hi>

It's the property of God's Children to admire that He loves

He loves not <hi>All alike.</hi> Who am I (ſays <hi>David</hi>) that thou <hi>haſt

'Tis therefore the more ſtrange to conſider, Why and how,
<hi>any</hi> that call themſelves of the Brotherhood, came ſo to eſpouſe
the quarrel of thoſe <hi>without;</hi> and that with ſuch <hi>Eagerneſs,</hi>

happy; and that againſt the Natural bent of their
own will; was a Grace much more high and Sovereign,
than to ſave them for their own better improvement of
what they have in common with other Men: (For that
would not be of Grace but of Debt.) Or, if the Lord ſhould

the exceeding Riches of the grace of God, in that

how it would have gon, if left to the wiſdom of Men.</p>
                  <p>But I ſhall not doubt to affirm, That this Doctrine of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction's

flowes not from, nor is ſounded upon, any condition to be

<hi>All</hi> that conduceth to life and Godlineſs; (Theſe things,

                  <p>2. <hi>After</hi> a man comes to Believe, this Doctrine of <hi>Abſolute</hi>
Election, is of ſingular uſe and benefit to him, both as tending
to keep him on his feet, and to raiſe him when he is down.</p>
                  <p>(1) It is a great Preſervative in time of Temptation:
The Remembrance of <hi>that love</hi> which looked upon him,
when he was in his blood, and ſaid he ſhould live, and hath
now alſo made good its Word to him; muſt needs operate
<hi>ſtrongly</hi> with a gratious heart, againſt what ever might

that <hi>both theſe (viz.</hi> This Love and this Power) are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
by an <hi>Abſolute</hi> Covenant to bring every one that takes

not only <hi>After,</hi> upon his Return to his Duty; but in the

that it is an imperfect thing; and ſo, cannot be Reckoned

Thoſe He would Juſtifie, into Chriſt; That He being

the Righteouſneſs of God in Him; and ſo, God might

is given us on the account of our Intereſt therein,<note place="margin">Phil. 1. 29.</note> that we
might apprehend it; and enjoy the Benefits of it: Which
is ſurely, a far better Ground to build our Juſtification up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

look towards the Vinyard, until he have agreed for his
penny: (which yet, he is not Content with when he has
it) The Other goes in and falls to his Work; and leaves
to his Maſter, to give him What is meet; which alſo he
leaves to his Maſter's Judgment,<note place="margin">Mat. 20. 2, 7, and 10.</note> and not his Own: and
truly, he ſpeeds ne'r the worſe for his ſo doing. (But I
would not be taken to intend a Contentation or Willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

                  <p>2 Do you Own God's Sovereign Commands without
diſputing? <hi>Abraham</hi> did thus, in the buſineſs of <hi>Iſaac;</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though

Children do. They know that their Lord is a
Great King, hath abſolute Dominion, and giveth accompt
of none of his Matters: What He is pleas'd to Command,
their duty is to obey, without asking a Reaſon Why?
Or, how will theſe things Conſiſt? Such demands (they
know) become not the lips of thoſe who live upon Grace.</p>
                  <p>3 Doth your love towards God, hold the ſame Courſe
that His love hath done towards you? All that God hath
done, or will do for His Choſen, it is the Product of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
love:</hi> Does all your Obedience Riſe from <hi>Love?</hi> And
does this love of <hi>yours</hi> grow out of <hi>His?</hi> Is His Electing
love the <hi>Root</hi> of it? Is all that you do towards God, in a
way of <hi>Gratitude?</hi> and with Deſigne to Glorifie His Grace?
And when the Lord ſeems to go from you, Do ye follow
the harder after Him? As He, for a long time, followed
you, waiting That He might be Gracious unto you. This
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:60927:55"/>
is truly a God-like Love; The eminency whereof lies in
this, That He loved us when enemies to Him; and loved
us into a likeneſs to Himſelf: Anſwerable whereto, we
ſhall love Him,<note place="margin">Job. 13. 15.</note> even whiles our fears may apprehend Him
to be our enemy: And through the power of His Love
ſecretly working in our hearts, go on to love Him, until
the Glory of the Lord be Riſen upon us. You could not
<hi>thus</hi> love God,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 19.</note> if He had not loved you <hi>firſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4 Do you Rejoyce in the thoughts of Electing love,
<hi>What</hi> it is, and <hi>Whence</hi> it came? What it hath deſigned you
for, and will bring you unto at laſt? Is it your delight to
Converſe with the Book of Life? And do you Rejoyce
more That your Names are written in Heaven, than if De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
were Subject to you? When your fleſh and your heart
fail you, do you look to Electing Love as your Strength
and Portion, and Count it a <hi>Goodly heritage?</hi> Do you aim
at That which Electing Love hath defigned you for, and
becauſe ſo Deſigned; If by any Means you may attain to it?
And are you better Satisfied to be at the Good Pleaſure of
God, than at your own? And bleſs his Wiſdom and Grace,
for undertaking the diſpoſure of your Eternal Intereſt?
Such fruit could not be, but from <hi>that Seed of God.</hi>

the 2, 6, 9, 21, 24, 26, verſes of that 17 <hi>John.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. We find, That [<hi>Church</hi>] and [<hi>Elect</hi>] are but two ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Titles of the ſame perſons, in a ſeveral reſpect:
[<hi>Elect</hi>] as Choſen of God to Salvation; and ſo, they are
called <hi>The Church of [God,</hi>] and ſaid to be <hi>Sanctified by God
the Father,</hi> Jude v. 1. And <hi>the Church of [Chriſt</hi>] as given or
committed to Him by the Father in order to that Salvation,
<hi>John</hi> 17. 6. It was this Church to whom the Apoſtles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
their Epiſtles, where we find them ſometimes inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t'led
[<hi>Beloved of God</hi>] Rom. 1. 7. Sometimes, <hi>The Church
of God,</hi> and <hi>Sanctified in Chriſt;</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 2. At other
times, <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Faithful Brethren in Chriſt;</hi> Col. 1. 2.
Then, <hi>Churches of the Saints,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 33. And <hi>Church
of the Firſt-born,</hi> Heb. 12. 23. And ſometime, expreſly
[Elect] 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 2. By all which is ſignified, That the
Church of Chriſt conſiſts of <hi>Elect perſons:</hi> That theſe vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Appellations, are but ſo many terms indifferently uſed
about the ſame Subject; and <hi>All</hi> as Notes of diſtinction
from the <hi>World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When Chriſt ſhall appear in His Glory, then ſhall His
Members be gathered to Him; <hi>Zach. 14. 5. The Lord my
God ſhall come, and [all the Saints] with thee.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi>
(diſeourſing the ſame thing) ſays, <hi>They that are Chriſt's at
His coming;</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 23. which ſhews, That they are
Chriſt's ſo as Others are not. And that it is meant of Elect
perſons, appears by our Saviour's own words, when
ſpeaking of that His Coming, and of the ſame Perſons
who are ſaid to be <hi>His,</hi> and to <hi>come with Him,</hi> He gives
them expreſly <hi>That</hi> Denomination, <hi>He ſhall ſend forth His
Angels, and they ſhall gather together His [Elect</hi>] Mat. 24.
33. But, as for the <hi>Reſt</hi> of the Dead, <hi>they lived not again
till a Thouſand years after;</hi> Rev. 20. 5. Therefore, theſe
[<hi>Reſt</hi>] were no part of <hi>This</hi> Body. It may alſo be noted,
That thoſe who did not Riſe with the Saints, are ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
here by the ſame Word or Note of diſtinction, as Thoſe
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:60927:59"/>
                  <hi>Not-Elected</hi> are in <hi>Rom. 11. The Election hath obtained,
and the</hi> [Reſt] <hi>were blinded;</hi> v. 7. And that Thoſe who
had part in the <hi>firſt Reſurrection,</hi> are the ſame perſons that
are <hi>written in the Lamb's book of life,</hi> is evident, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
<hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 4. with <hi>chap.</hi> 13. 8.</p>
               <p>III. It was of Neceſſity, that the Body or Church of
Chriſt ſhould be compoſed of the <hi>Elect Seed;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. Becauſe none elſe were <hi>fit</hi> to be of this Body, but
ſuch as ſhould be <hi>like</hi> the Head of it. Carnal Members
would be as uncomely to a Spiritual Head, as one of the
Brutes to be <hi>Adam's</hi> companion. The King's Daughter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elect
(to make her a ſuitable match for his Son) muſt be
<hi>all-glorious within:</hi> Not only of the ſame outward metal,
(for ſo were thoſe other Creatures with <hi>Adam</hi>) but made
in the ſame Mould, and indued with the ſame Spirit and
Underſtanding: There muſt be a congruity in all the parts
throughout: They muſt be copies of Him; each one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling
the Children of a King:<note place="margin">Judg. 8. 18.</note> If the Head be Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
ſo muſt the Members: They cannot walk together, if
not thus agreed.</p>
               <p>2. This likeneſs to Chriſt is proper to the Elect: It's a
Royal priviledge intailed upon them, and cannot deſcend
or Revert to any out of that line. That this likeneſs to
Chriſt is requiſite to all His Members, and alſo peculiar
to Elect Perſons, are both atteſted in Rom. 8. 29. <hi>Whom
He did fore know, He alſo did Predeſtinate to be conformed to
the Image of His Son; that He might be the Firſt-born among
many Brethren:</hi> Which implies, that the <hi>Fore-known</hi> (or
Elect) only are predeſtinate thereto; and, that were it
not for Predeſtination, the <hi>Firſt-born</hi> ſhould have but a
thin Aſſembly to Preſide amongſt: (indeed, nothing but
blanks for His great adventure and long expectation.) In
<hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 3, 4, 5. he further appropriates thoſe Spiritual bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
(by which Men are conformed to Chriſt) to the ſame
perſons; <hi>Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus
Chriſt, who hath bleſſed us with all ſpiritual bleſſings in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
things in Chriſt; [According as He hath Choſen] us in
Him:—Having Predeſtinated us to the Adoption of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:60927:60"/>
&amp;c.</hi> By theſe two Scriptures it appears, that <hi>God's
Children</hi> and <hi>Chriſt's Brethren</hi> are the ſame perſons; and
that they were made ſo by Election. But, are Chriſt's <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi>
and His <hi>Church</hi> the ſame Perſons? Take your ſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from Hebr. 2. 12. <hi>I will declare thy Name unto my [Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren]
In the midſt of the [Church] will I ſing praiſe unto
Thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. This <hi>likeneſs to Chriſt</hi> is not attainable by <hi>any</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
firſt being in Him as their Head; For which cauſe the
Elect were Choſen <hi>in Him.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 1. 4.</note> It is out of Chriſt's fulneſs
that all Grace is received: and in order to that Reception,
there muſt be <hi>

Vine. For which cauſe and end, the deſigned Members of
His Body were ſeperated from their wild Olive root, and
put into Chriſt by Election: And hereby they are made
partakers of the fatneſs of that Heavenly Root; (<hi>i. e.</hi> of
the Spirit of Chriſt, which is called the Anointing, in
1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 27.) In this reſpect the Firſt and Second <hi>Adams</hi>
are ſet-forth as <hi>paralels</hi> touching headſhip to their reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Bodies. As from <hi>Adam</hi> their natural Head, all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
have derived their natural being; So from Chriſt
their Spiritual Head, do all the Elect Seed receive their
Spiritual being and Nature. On which account he is ſtiled
<hi>The everlaſting Father,</hi> and They <hi>His Children;</hi> Iſa. 9. 6.
Heb. 2. 13. They were all in Chriſt from Eternity, in as
juſt (but ſpiritual) a Reality, as Mankind in <hi>Adam,</hi> or
<hi>Levi</hi> in <hi>Abraham's</hi> loyns when <hi>Melchiſedee</hi> met him. <hi>Eve's</hi>
production (as to the manner of it) was paternal of this:
She was made of <hi>Adam's</hi> ſubſtance, but ſhe came not out
of his loyns, but out of his Side: So is the New Creature
extracted out of Chriſt's; They are <hi>bone of His bones, and
fleſh of his fleſh;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 2. 21-23.</note> (ſpiritually underſtood.) And none can
thus proceed from Him, but ſuch as were in Him <hi>Decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively</hi>
by <hi>Election:</hi> Men are bleſſed with theſe ſpiritual bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings,
as being in Chriſt, and not otherwiſe: <hi>Eph. 1. 4.

<hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 20.</p>
               <p>4. Look to this your Head for ſupply of all Grace:

Hold to your Head, leſt Notions beguile you of your
Reward, <hi>Col. 2. v.</hi> 18, 19. Be ſure, withall, that you keep

deny it ſelf for the ſafety and aſſiſtance of That which
is more Noble: This (in a degree) is to lay down our life
for the Brethren. He that in theſe things ſerveth Chriſt, is

               <head>The Ground and Truth of this Aſſertion, is further confirm'd
by ſuch Arguments as theſe:</head>
               <p>I. The Levitical Sacrifices were offered for the Houſe
of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Arg. 1.</note> exemptive of other Nations; (Save only ſuch as
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:60927:64"/>
became Proſelytes:) And Theſe being a Type of the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Election,</hi> It followes That this Sacrifice of Chriſt (typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by Theirs) was alſo Peculiar to <hi>Jews in Spirit;</hi> or
Spiritual Jews. So, <hi>Aarons's</hi> making atonement for his
<hi>Houſehold,</hi> and bearing the names of the <hi>twelve Tribes</hi>
on his breaſt-plate, were typical of our Great High Prieſt's
bearing the Names and ſuſtaining the perſons of <hi>thoſe</hi> for
whom He offered Himſelf on the Croſs. Of all thoſe legal
ſhadows, Chriſt and the Church of the firſt-born, are the
Body and Subſtance.</p>
               <p>II. The <hi>Right of Redemption</hi> among the Jews (which ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
this) was founded on <hi>Brotherhood:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Arg. 2.</note> Hence I infer,
That <hi>that</hi> Relation (ſpiritually taken) was both the <hi>Ground</hi>
and <hi>Limit</hi> of Chriſt's office as a Redeemer. The Apoſtle's
diſcourſe in <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. ſeems to point at this; where he ſayes
They were <hi>Brethren, Children,</hi> and <hi>Sons,</hi> whom Chriſt ſhould
<hi>deliver from bondage; Make Reconciliation for their Sins, and
bring to Glory.</hi> But, how came they to be God's Children
and Brethren to Chriſt, <hi>above others?</hi> It was by <hi>Predeſtination;</hi>
and <hi>That</hi> was it entituled them to Redemption; as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
by comparing the 5 and 7 verſes of <hi>Eph. 1. Having
predeſtinated us to the Adoption of Children by Jeſus Chriſt;
In whom we have [Redemption] through His blood.</hi> And
'tis worthy your notice, That by the law of Redemption,
a <hi>ſtranger</hi> (that is, One that was not of the Brotherhood)
<hi>might not</hi> be Redeemed;<note place="margin">Levit. 25 46. &amp; 48. with 41. &amp; 54.</note> But One that was, though he were

Election; then all the ſaving benefits of Redemption (which
are the ſame with thoſe of Election) muſt be diſpenſed by
the ſame Rule; and ſo, to the ſame perſons onely. We
alſo find,<note place="margin">Joh. 17. 6.</note> That Chriſt's actual diſtribution of the Gifts
He received for Men, is guided anſwerably: <hi>He manifeſts
the Father's name to the Men He had given Him [<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ut] of
the world:</hi> To <hi>Theſe</hi> He expounds that in private, which
to others He ſpake in parables: And thus He did, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
to <hi>them</hi> it was <hi>given</hi> to know the Myſteries of the
Kingdom of God,<note place="margin">Math. 13. 34. &amp; 36. ver</note> but to the <hi>Multitude</hi> it was <hi>not</hi> given;
And <hi>Election</hi> was That as gave it them, (as it followes
there) <hi>For So it ſeemed good in thy ſight.</hi> In like manner,
the Apoſtle in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. puts Election and Redemption <hi>toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
as pertaining to the <hi>ſame</hi> perſons; And Juſtification
(which is the next effect of <hi>Redemption</hi>) he makes
alſo an unqueſtionable conſequent of <hi>Election: Who ſhall
lay any thing to the charge of God's Elect? It is God that
juſtifieth: Who ſhall condemn? It is Chriſt that dyed.</hi> The
queſtion being put concerning <hi>God's Elect,</hi> and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
referring to thoſe for whom <hi>Chriſt dy'd;</hi> is a plain
implication, That <hi>Redemption</hi> and <hi>Iuſtification</hi> are commenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
with <hi>Election;</hi> That <hi>either</hi> of them concerneth one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the <hi>ſame</hi> perſons; and that <hi>neither</hi> of them extends to
any, but whom the other alſo taketh-in.</p>
               <p>IV. The price of Redemption was of that <hi>Precious</hi> and
<hi>Matchleſs Value,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Arg. 4.</note> that it could not be parted-with, but with
reſpect to the <hi>Certainty of the End</hi> for which it was paid.
Now the <hi>End</hi> of Redemption was the Salvation of Men;
below Which there could not be an End worthy the death
of Chriſt; And <hi>This</hi> Nothing could ſecure but <hi>Election;</hi> The
<hi>Elect</hi> alwaies have <hi>abtain'd,</hi> and ſhall: This is a Rule affirm'd
in <hi>Rom:</hi> 11. 7. But for the <hi>Reſt, they are blinded;</hi> that is, They are
left to their own voluntary Miſunderſtanding; And being ſo,
Not only they <hi>Do not,</hi>

end ſhould Chriſt make <hi>His Precious Soul</hi> an Offering for
<hi>Such!</hi> Men that <hi>never</hi> ſhall believe; and conſequently <hi>never</hi>
be Saved? Surely To no better purpoſe than for the World of
ungodly, whoſe Spirits were in priſon two thouſand years

afore. Thoſe whom the Lord intends to ſave alive, He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points
an Atonement to be made for them;<note place="margin">Numb. 16. ver. 46, 47.</note> But for thoſe
He intends to kill, (which is alwaies done juſtly) He will
not <hi>accept</hi> an Offering,<note place="margin">Judg. 13. 23</note> and therefore not <hi>appoint it;</hi> As He
did not (under the Law) for thoſe Crimes which Men were

               <p>V. <hi>I</hi> confine Redemption to Elect perſons,<note place="margin">Arg. 5.</note> becauſe <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsion</hi>
(which is of equal latitude with <hi>Redemption</hi>) is limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to <hi>Theſe</hi> excluſive to <hi>Others.</hi> The Prieſts of old, were
to pray for thoſe whoſe ſacrifice they offered; And what
they did, was a patern of our Saviour's Prieſtly office;
Whom likewiſe we finde to Sacrifice and pray, <hi>onely</hi> for
the <hi>ſame</hi> perſons: He is an <hi>Advocate</hi> for thoſe for whoſe
ſins He is <hi>a Propitiation,</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 1. Whoſe tranſgreſſions
He was <hi>ſmitten</hi> for, For them He makes <hi>Interceſſion,</hi> Iſa. 53. 8,
12. For <hi>their</hi> ſakes He Sanctified Himſelf, and for <hi>Them</hi>
it was that He made that ſolemn prayer in the 17, of
John. And He now <hi>prayes</hi> for them, as being juſt now
to-<hi>offer their Sacrifice:</hi> He alſo ſhuts out the World ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
from having any intereſt in it, <hi>I pray not for the World,
but for them which Thou haſt given Me.</hi> And He adds
the Reaſon (the foundation Reaſon) why He would pray
for <hi>Theſe, [For, they are Thine] i. e.</hi> They were the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
by <hi>Election:</hi> For, in all other reſpects the Earth
is the Lord's, and the Fullneſs thereof.</p>
               <p>VI. This Doctrine is further Warranted,<note place="margin">Arg. 6.</note> by thoſe Genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
and Neceſſary Concluſions, which follow from divers
expreſs Scriptures touching this Subject; As 1. That thoſe
who are planted with Chriſt in His death, ſhall be alſo in
His Reſurrection, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 5. 2. That thoſe for whom Chriſt
was Crucified, their old Man was Crucified with Him;
That the body of ſin ſhould be deſtroyed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 6.
3. That thoſe dead with Chriſt, are freed from ſin; and
ſhall appear with Him in Glory, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 7. and <hi>Coll</hi> 3. 3, 4.
4. That thoſe for whom Chriſt dy'd, are Juſtified and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 8, 9, 10. 5. That for whom He was made
ſin and a Curſe, They are made the Righteouſneſs of God
in Him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21. 6. They that are Redeemed, do
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:60927:66"/>
follow the Lamb; and are made Kings and Prieſts unto God,
<hi>Rev</hi> 5. 9, 10. <hi>Chap.</hi> 14. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4.</p>
               <p>All which bleſſings (with many the like) are the inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
fruits of Redemption. But it is obvious to all,
That <hi>all</hi> men are not like unto Chriſt in Newneſs of life:
<hi>All</hi> have not the body of ſin deſtroyed in them: <hi>All</hi> are not
freed from ſin: Nor ſhall <hi>All</hi> appear with Chriſt in Glory:
<hi>All</hi> are not Juſtified and Reconciled: <hi>All</hi> are not made the
Righteouſneſs of God in Chriſt: <hi>All</hi> do not follow the
Lamb: Nor are <hi>All</hi> made Kings and Prieſts unto God:
Whence it ſhould follow, That <hi>All</hi> are not Redeemed.</p>
               <p>VII. Another Argument for <hi>Peculiar</hi> Redemption,<note place="margin">Arg. 7.</note> is
founded on the <hi>End</hi> of Chriſt's death, with the <hi>Merit</hi> and
<hi>Efficacy</hi> of it:<note place="margin">Tit. 2. 14.</note> He gave Himſelf, That He might Redeem
thoſe He dyed for, from <hi>all iniquity:</hi> Hence it follows, That
if Chriſt dyed for all, then <hi>All</hi> ſhall be ſaved; (for iniquity
only can be their Ruin) Or elſe, That Chriſt fails of the
End of his Death. But, Chriſt cannot fall ſhort of His
End in dying; For, all power in Heaven and Earth is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to Him, for the Making of it good: And yet, <hi>All</hi>
Men are not ſaved: (The Saved Ones are but a Remnant)
Therefore He gave not Himſelf to Redeem <hi>All.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is the Father's will, That of All He hath given to Chriſt

Hence it follows; Either, That <hi>all</hi> men were not thus gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to Chriſt; or if they were, Then <hi>All</hi> muſt have Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
life; And if they have Not, The Father's Will is Not

All men are not <hi>Juſtified,</hi> juſtification doth not <hi>belong</hi> to
all; and conſequently, That Chriſt did not give Himſelf for
<hi>All.</hi> And as touching <hi>Efficacy; Adam's</hi> tranſgreſſion was

doth for all alike; and not a jot more for the one party than
for the other. (6) It makes Men preſumptuous and carnal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſecure. How many have ſooth'd-up themſelves in their
impenitency and hardneſs of Heart, and fenced themſelves
againſt the Word; upon this very Suppoſition, That Chriſt
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:60927:67"/>
died for all, and therefore for them: And why then ſhould
not they look to be ſaved as well as any other? and ſo they
lean (pretendedly) on the Lord and tranſgreſs: Not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering,
that thoſe for whom Chriſt died, He purchaſed for
them a freedom from ſin, and not a liberty of Sinning; Nor
impunity, but upon terms of Faith and Repentance. And
that the Tempter diſturbs them not in their reſt upon ſuch
a foundation, may be a principal Reaſon why Men ſo ſtifly
adhere to it; and that thoſe of the <hi>General</hi> principle are
ſo ſeldom troubled with terrours of Conſcience.</p>
               <p>But yet, (notwithſtanding all this) it is not denied, that
all Men, even thoſe that never heard of Chriſt's Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
have benefit by His death, (and more might have,
did they not ſtand in their own light) albeit He had not,
in His death, the ſame reſpect to <hi>all</hi> as to <hi>ſome.</hi> The mix'd
Multitude that came up with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> It was not for <hi>them</hi>
that <hi>Moſes</hi> was ſent to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> That the Sea was divided,
and the <hi>Egyptians</hi> drowned; That the Rock followed the
Camp, and that they had <hi>Mannah</hi> from Heaven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
though theſe being in company with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> had a ſhare in
thoſe outward benefits. So the Lord gives water in the
Wilderneſs; by which the <hi>Beaſts</hi> and <hi>Owls</hi> have benefit, in
their kind; and yet it is not for <hi>their</hi> ſakes that the Lord

2. He that will know his own particular Redemption

Work; and is very unlikely to come (that way) to the

                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 2.</note> It muſt be intended of the <hi>World of ungodly;</hi>
For, the Saints ſhall not Judge one another. That <hi>All the

of Thoſe who followed the Lamb. And again, <hi>The

                  <note place="margin">1 Job. 5. 19.</note> Here ye have the very
words, and in the ſame Manner connex'd, as in the place
objected; which therefore may well be ſuppoſed to be of

the <hi>

under the power and conduct of Satan; which the Saints
are not; and ſo, cannot be any part of the [World] or
[whole World] there intended.</p>
               <p>The other ſenſe of the Word, ſeems Couched in the
places objected; where Chriſt is ſaid, To take away the ſin
of the <hi>World;</hi> And to be a Propitiation for the ſins of the
<hi>whole World:</hi> For it ſeems Agreeable to Reaſon, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the word in a Reſtrict and limited ſenſe here, as in

By like Reaſon, at other times, it may be meant of the

Maintained, That Faith is the one thing neceſſary on our

this Faith adds nothing of <hi>virtue</hi> or <hi>Merit</hi> to the Croſs of

outſide, and fair ſhew in the fleſh, are no Argument
of Truth in the bottom. Takingneſs with Nature, ſhould
Render things ſuſpitious to us, rather than approved. Our
beſt rule of Judgement in this caſe, is that of our Saviour;
<hi>The Tree is known by its fruits.</hi> And if by <hi>this</hi> we meaſure
the <hi>general point,</hi> it will be found wanting in what it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to, and not-a-little Reprovable.</p>
               <p>1. In ſtead of Magnifying the Grace of Chriſt, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of His ſufferings, it does (in effect.) Nullifie both. It
makes Redemption general as to <hi>Perſons,</hi> but not as to
<hi>Things:</hi> That is, it Redeems the whole of Mankind from <hi>part</hi>
of their bondage; but no part of them from the <hi>whole</hi> of
it;) Or upon ſuch a Condition as no Man in nature is able to
perform: which (ſure) is too defective to be the Deviſe of
Sovereign Wiſdome and Grace: That cannot be call'd An
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:60927:71"/>
Univerſal Remedy that ſuffers it ſelf to be Worſted by the
diſeaſe. I doubt not at all, That the blood of the Son of
God in our Nature, is of infinite Merit; but withall,
that is of like Infinite Virtue and Efficacy; and will for ever
operate accordingly. But, if the ſucceſs and ſaving effects
thereof ſhould depend upon ſomething to be done by Men,
which Redemption it ſelf doth not Inveſt them with; then
will Men come in for a ſhare with Chriſt, in the glory of
their Salvation: yea, in this caſe, any addition of humane
ability, annihilates the Grace of Chriſt; <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 2. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,
to depend upon Chriſt for Sanctifiction as well as Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs;
To expect from Him a <hi>Power</hi> to Repent
and Believe, as well as Acceptance upon your believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
gives Him His true honour, as intit'ling Him to the
<hi>whole</hi> of your Salvation; which is (indeed) His proper
Due, and due to Him <hi>alone.</hi> And this may be a main Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
why Men profeſſing the Name of Chriſt are ſo
generally ſtrangers to Faith and Holineſs: They do not ſeek
it at the hands of Chriſt as a part of His purchaſe, according
to <hi>John</hi> 5. 40.</p>
               <p>2. In ſtead of laying a foundation for Faith, and an help
to believing; the <hi>General</hi> Doctrine nuzzles the Soul in its
unbelief upon a preſumption of Power in himſelf to believe
when he will. We litle think how much preſumption and
carnal ſecurity derive from this Root: whereas <hi>Peculiar</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
in the vigour and latitude of it, (<hi>viz.</hi> as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
us a <hi>Right</hi> to Faith and Holineſs, with the Spirit
of Chriſt to work them effectually in us;) is a far greater
incouragement to apply our ſelves to Chriſt for them, as a
part of His purchaſe;<note place="margin">Phil. 1. 29.</note> and <hi>that</hi> without which we cannot
partake the other benefits of His death. And I cannot but
think, that any Man in His right mind, (upon a due enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and thorow conſidering the Matter) would rathet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon ſuch a Redemption, as redeems from all iniquity;
(though the perſons concern'd in that Redemption, be but
few) than on <hi>that</hi> which is ſuppoſed to Redeem All univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally
upon condition of Faith and Repentance, but does not
Reedeem from impenitency and unbelief. In <hi>That Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:60927:71"/>
let my part be that ſaves from Sin; That ſlayes the

that have Salvation at the End of them.</p>
               <p>II. Since your propriety in Redemption is founded on
your Intereſt in Electing love;<note place="margin">Infer. 2.</note> Give all diligence to make
your Election ſure; Spare not for pains; It's fruit will be
worth all the coſt and labour you can beſtow upon it:
If cleer in this point, the whole body will be full of light.
And, among other Evidences of Election, Look over thoſe
ſpecified afore under that head. Then Make out your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
in Redemption, by walking worthy of Redeeming
love; which cannot be done, but by being and doing fome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<hi>more than others:</hi> Some <hi>ſingular</hi> thing it muſt be, that
muſt warrant your claim to that ſingular <hi>Priviledge.</hi> Hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
therefore in your life, the effects of your Union with
Chriſt in His death: As he gave Himſelf for you; ſo give up
your ſelf to Him. As He is for you; ſo, be you for
Him (for Him only) and not for another: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 5.
<hi>Hoſea</hi> 3. 3.</p>
               <p>1. Determine to know nothing, but Jeſus Chriſt and
Him Crucified: Count all things elſe not worth your know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
for in truth all knowledge, without this, will come
to Nothing. Let all (therefore) be loſs and dung, for the
excellency of the Knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus our Lord,
<hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8.</p>
               <p>2. Let nothing be ſo dear to you, as not to part with it
for God, when 'tis called for; and riſe early to do it. <hi>This
is love,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Joh. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>that we walk after His Commandments.</hi> The Lord
parted with His delight for you from Eternity: There's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more Reaſonable, Nothing more Natural, to an heart
rightly placed; than that you ſhould love and live to Him,
who died for you: And, whoever hath known the Grace of
God, and the love of Chriſt, in truth; cannot but ſo
judge.</p>
               <p>3. Let not Chriſt be Divided: Know Him for your <hi>Lord</hi>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:60927:72"/>
aſwell as your <hi>Redeemer;</hi> Take Orders from Him as your
Captain General; Receive your Law from His Mouth;
What ever He bids you do, Do it; Follow Him where
ever He goes; and Carry it ſo as becomes His Attendants:
The Armies in Heaven follow Him upon white Horſes,<note place="margin">Rev 19. 14.</note> and
arrayed in white: Be not your own Director in any thing,
Nor over-haſty; Stir not up your Beloved until He pleaſe;
But Await His Counſel and Conduct, as preferring His
knowledge of times and Seaſons, with the manner and
method of His Working and preſcribing, before your
own.</p>
               <p>4. Let Nothing divide you from Chriſt: Let Nothing
but death, yea, let not death it ſelf, ſeparate between you
and Him. Nothing (you ſee) could ſeparate Him from you;
yea,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 20.</note> had it not been for you, and ſuch as you are, He had
not dyed. <hi>We are not our own, we are bought with a price;</hi>
which is the higheſt engagement, in every ſtate and Duty;
whether living or dying,<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>to be the Lord's.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>III. Chriſts giving Himſelf a Ranſom for you:<note place="margin">Infer. 3.</note> warrants
your largeſt expectation of Good things from Him: What
Sins too great to be pardoned? or iniquities ſo ſtubborn as
not to be ſubdued?<note place="margin">Heb. 9. 14</note> or Graces ſo precious, as not to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained?
The Lord delights in nothing more than Mercy;
The only Bar was Sin; which being diſſolved by the bloud
of Chriſt, Grace and Glory run freely. The making us
Kings and Prieſts unto God, yea, <hi>One in the Father and Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi>
being the thing He dyed for;<note place="margin">Joh. 17. 21.</note> no inferiour good thing
can be withholden from us <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Holyneſs</hi> are great
things (indeed) and highly to be valued: yet let me ſay,
That even theſe and all other good things, when layed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together;
will be but a very little heap to that Grace
which put us into Chriſt;<note place="margin">1 Joh. 4 10.</note> the honour and priviledge of
Union with Him; and the price He hath paid for our Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom:
Herein is Love that God ſent His Son to be the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation
for our Sins: The Purchaſe is paid; Releafes are
Sealed; and He in poſſeſſion; All things are ready: It is
now but His Giving forth the Revenue that lies by Him;
which alſo He delights to do.</p>

IV. This Doctrine alſo prepares a Chief corner Stone
for the Saints Perſeverance. They for whom Chriſt died,
died with Him; and if dead with Him, they ſhall live
with Him; <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 8. Even the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of God is
engaged to <hi>Save</hi> them; and then He muſt either prevent,
Remove, or Over-rule, what ever would hinder that Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
Therefore unto Him that loved us, and waſhed
us from our ſins in His own blood,<note place="margin">Rev. 1. 5, 6.</note> be glory and dominion,
for ever and ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>

It was not the mere depoſiting of the Ranſom deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
as a pledge to ſecure the Creditor's Satisfaction, in caſe
the Treaty took effect: Nor was it ſuch a pledge as might
be reſum'd or paid-back, in caſe it ſucceeded not: Neither

need the addition of any thing from without it ſelf, to make
it effectual: But ſuch a Price it was, ſo paid, ſo accepted,

the Actual and Eternal Deliverance from Sin, Satan, Death,

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:60927:73"/>

affirm'd, but evident proof will make it good. A Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
or two for each of theſe.</p>
               <p>1. The Redemption wrought by Chriſt imports <hi>Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction:</hi>

<hi>the blood of Jeſus,</hi> Heb 10. 19. and Rev. 5. 9, 10. <hi>That
haſt Redeemed us unto God by thy blood; and haſt made us
Kings and Prieſts:</hi> (It is the voice of Thoſe in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.)</p>
               <p>Now, <hi>All theſe</hi> are in Redemption, they proceed out of

that <hi>Paul</hi> cared not to know any thing but Jeſus Chriſt and

His Aſcention, Sitting at God's right hand, and Interceſſion
have their reſpective influence into every of thoſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars

If He had not dyed, He had not been a Prieſt for ever (as
He is) after the order of <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> Heb. 9. 12.</p>
               <p>II. Another Argument is from the ineſtimable worth
and dignity of the Ranſom that was given:<note place="margin">Arg. 2.</note> It was <hi>the life
of the Son of God;</hi> Matth. 20. 28. Heaven and Earth will
bear no proportion in value to this price of Redemption:
which therefore could not be parted-with for a doubtful or
uncertain Purchaſe. In this lies the ſtreſs of the Apoſtle's
Argument; Who when He would ſet forth the happy
eſtate of God's Elect, and prove them above the Reach of
danger; He doth it in two words, (but very ſignificant
ones) [<hi>Chriſt hath dyed] Who ſhall condemn? It is [Chriſt
that dyed</hi>] Rom. 8. 38. The <hi>Eminency</hi> of the Perſon, and
the <hi>ſufferings</hi> He ſubmitted to; as they greatly illuſtrate
His love to Men; So they ſtrongly affirm and inſure the
<hi>event</hi> of His death: <hi>If reconciled to God by the death of [His
Son] much more Saved by His life,</hi> Rom. 5. 10. It may
truly be ſaid of every one He died for,<note place="margin">Ezek. 18. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>He is juſt, He ſhall
ſurely live.</hi> But this in the ſame reſpect and ſenſe, as thoſe
then unborn were ſaid to be <hi>ſanctified</hi> through the offering
of the body of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 10. And their <hi>Old Man
to be crucified with Him:</hi> Rom. 6. No Man is <hi>actually</hi> juſtified
till he actually believes: But Repentance and Faith being
purchaſed by Chriſt, for thoſe He died for; They ſhall
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:60927:74"/>
as certainly be made to Repent and Believe, as that Chriſt
died for them, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 29.</p>
               <p>III. The Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is more prevalent and
effectual to <hi>His</hi> Seed,<note place="margin">Arg. 3.</note> than <hi>Adam's</hi> tranſgreſſion was to <hi>his:</hi>
All his Poſterity (indeed) fell under the Curſe by it; yet ſo,
that there was ſtill (through the Intervention of Grace)
a poſſibility of Releaſe: But the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt
hath ſo perfectly recovered and 'ſtabliſhed His Seed, that
their juſtified 'ſtate can never be loſt. And the Reaſon is,
becauſe Grace hath out-done Sin, and gone beyond it,
<hi>Grace hath abounded much more,</hi> Rom. 5. 20. Which <hi>ſuper-abounding</hi>
of Grace, cannot referr to the <hi>Subjects</hi> of Grace,
as if they were <hi>more in number</hi> than the Subjects of Sin;
(for, ſin came upon <hi>All,</hi> and Grace cannot come upon <hi>more</hi>
than all:) But 'tis meant of the <hi>prevalent efficacy</hi> of Grace;
and the <hi>permanency</hi> of its effects towards all that are the
Subjects of it:<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 21.</note> And, thence it is, that Grace is ſaid to <hi>Reign,</hi>
and that to <hi>Eternal life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IV. If the End of Chriſt's death might poſſibly be fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate;<note place="margin">Arg. 4.</note>
as poſſibly the very end of God's making the World,
might ſuffer diſappointment. All things were made for Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
and by this ſcale they aſcend to Him; The World for the
Elect,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 22, 23.</note> The Elect for Chriſt, and Chriſt for God. All His
works praiſe Him; but above all, that of Redemption, as
of higheſt note and eminency. Moſt conſpicuouſly doth
the Glory of God ſhin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>-forth in the face of Chriſt as <hi>Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi>
and as dying for <hi>ſuch an End; (viz.</hi> the Salvation of
His People:) It is the chief of the wayes of God, the very
Meridian and height of His Glory, (not eſſential, but mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtative)
both in this world, and that to come. It therefore
behoved Him ſo to lay it, that of all his deſignments, <hi>This</hi>
might be ſure to ſucceed. For, do but ſubtract the <hi>ſureneſs</hi> of
its Effect; and leave His Redeem'd in a <hi>periſhable</hi> condition;
and it draws a <hi>blemiſh</hi> inſtead of <hi>beauty,</hi> upon all the Divine
Attributes.</p>
               <p>1. The end of God's ſetting forth Chriſt a Propitiation,<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 25, 26.</note>
was to <hi>declare His Righteouſneſs in the Remiſſion of ſins;</hi>
(which it does doubly,) 1. That without ſatisfaction,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:60927:75"/>
ſin could not juſtly be remitted. 2. That ſatisfaction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
given, it could not juſtly be imputed; <hi>Who ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn?
It is Chriſt that dyed.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 34.</note> But if thoſe for whom this
<hi>plenary ſatisfaction</hi> has been given, ſhould not be juſtified
and effectually ſaved, Divine Juſtice would be as liable to
impeachment, as if He had ſaved them without: And ſo,
the thing deſigned for the honour of His Righteouſneſs,
would turn to its diſparagement.</p>
               <p>2. It would not accord with the love and goodneſs of
God towards His Elect, that <hi>That</hi> which was meant for
their Recovery,<note place="margin">Joh. 3. 19.</note> and was alſo a price well-worthy their
Ranſom; ſhould poſſibly turn to their deeper condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
(for, ſo it muſt if they be not effectually ſaved:)
This could not be that Pleaſure of the Lord which ſhould
proſper in the hands of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>3. It would not be according to the <hi>Faithfulneſs</hi> and
<hi>Truth</hi> of God, that Chriſt ſhould fail of That He was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed,
and earneſtly looked-for, as the fruit of His Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
which was a <hi>Seed to ſerve Him:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſa 49 6. ch. 53. 10. Prov 8. 31.</note> The thoughts of
which were matter of complacency to Him from Everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting.
But if thoſe He died for, ſhould not only abide in
the ſame condemnation He came to deliver them from;
but under a much ſorer vengeance than if He had not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
for them; How grievous would it be to Him, and
contradictious to the Faithfulneſs of God!</p>
               <p>4. Another End of Redemption was, That the <hi>manifold
Wiſdom</hi> of God might ſhine-forth in the ſight of Angels and
Men. <hi>Chriſt crucified is the Wiſdom of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 24.
But if it were ſo contrived, that the Thing chiefly deſign'd
might poſſibly miſcarry, it would be no illuſtration of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
Will one of common prudence part with His Jewels
and choyceſt treaſure, and that in ſuch manner as never to
be regain'd, and leave his purchaſe knowingly under haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard?
Men (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>deed) may poſſibly waſte their Eſtates in
Tryals and Eſſayes that come to nothing, but did they
foreſee the ſucceſs, they would not ſo expoſe their pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to reproach.</p>
               <p>5. The <hi>Greatneſs</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of God would ſuffer an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſe,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:60927:75"/>
if it were in the power of Creatures to defeat. His

of His greateſt work: What would the Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
ſay, but that He deſtroyed them, becauſe not able to
go through with what He undertook? <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. 16.</p>
               <p>6. Laſtly, If the end of Chriſt's death might poſſibly be
fruſtrate; Then that bleſſed project for glorifying the
Grace of God, might poſſibly be diſannulled and come to
nothing: For, None but <hi>Saved</hi> Ones do or can glorifie that
Grace.</p>
               <p>V. Another Argument for the <hi>Sure effect</hi> of Chriſt's
death,<note place="margin">Arg. 5.</note> is, becauſe He hath the Management of the whole
work committed to Himſelf; as well the <hi>Application</hi> or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
as the <hi>procurement</hi> of it: He is the Repoſitory
Root, and Treaſury, wherein all the benefits of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
are laid up; and the Great Almoner by whoſe hand
they are diſpenſed. <hi>Adam</hi> was no more a publique, Perſon
after his fall: The new Stock was not intruſted with him,
but put into the hands of Chriſt, who will give a better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of it: For</p>
               <p>VI. There is Nothing wanting to Him (who is our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer)

               <p>(1) He knows what His work is; that it is, <hi>To ſeek and

His work was, To open the blind eyes; To bore the deaf

To heal the Sick; To raiſe the Dead; To caſt out
Devils; To preach the Goſpel, and to cauſe thoſe it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs

and He knows as well, that He is to <hi>Quicken</hi> them: and
thence we have it in <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 25, The <hi>Dead ſhall hear and

To raiſe them up at the laſt day, and to take them to

with, His work is before Him. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40 10.</p>
               <p>(2) As He knows His work, what it is; ſo the <hi>beſt
ſeaſon</hi> and <hi>method</hi> for its performance. He came in the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

came <hi>Then</hi> when there was moſt need of Him; the Devil's
Kingdom at the higheſt, his Oracles in greateſt credit, the

though He might have had more than twelve Legions of

Powers of darkneſs; yea, and the Wrath of His Father
too; which was much more grievous, and of far Greater
terrour, than all the Reſt. And in all this, He was <hi>Alone;</hi>
there was <hi>None</hi> with Him. And, that an Angel appear'd to

and <hi>Part</hi> of His <hi>deep humiliation,</hi> (That the Mighty

have this work perfected; <hi>He ever liveth to make Interceſſion</hi>
for Thoſe He died for, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. There is great weight

It is Chriſt that died; yea rather, that is Riſen again—Who
alſo [maketh Interceſſion] for us.</hi> And the ſum of His Prayer
is, (1) That Thoſe given to Him, might be kept from evil,
<hi>John</hi> 17. 15. (2) That they might be One in the Father and
Himſelf, v. 21. And (3) That they may be Where He is, to
behold His Glory, v. 24.</p>

Argument for the Doctrine of Peculiar Redemption (before

So is it here: Our buſineſs now, is, to diſplay our General's

               <p>There are Stragling parties (indeed) who watch for our

deſperate: Since he may not have quarter, he'l do all he
can, Not to die alone: He will ſtand on his Stumps when
his legs are off; or lye on his back, and fight: (for his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
is implicable) He will never give-over, till quite out of
breath; (and yet he will not be <hi>quite</hi> without, whiles we
have any; We muſt expire together) But here lies the odds;
That We, dying in the Conflict, ſhall riſe again with Marks
of honour; and our Laurel hold green to Eternity: yea,
we ſhall ſit with our Glorious Captain in His Triumphal
Chariot, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 21. but our enemy lies in eternal ſilence,
and his Name ſhall Rot; or be Remembred only to Greaten

of His improvement added to it: What Power the Father
gave to Him, He delegates to you; even a <hi>power over all the
power of the enemy;</hi> As it were an <hi>Antidote</hi> or <hi>Superſedeas,</hi> to
invalidate <hi>all</hi> that comes againſt you. Wherefore then

the advantages you have; Beſides the bruifing of your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie's

He hath choſen them to: It is God's revealing His Son <hi>in</hi>

is, to <hi>Sanctifie</hi> Whom the Father hath <hi>Elected,</hi> and Chriſt

               <p>The Great thing to be done <hi>for</hi> us (next after Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
is <hi>Redemption from ſin:</hi> This was a work of infinite mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

(This was the proper ſubject of the former Head.) The
end of which Redemption was To bring in the next ſort
of Things requiſite to Salvation, <hi>viz.</hi> Such as are to be
Done upon and in the Elect; namely, their Reconcilement
to God, and Receiving the Adoption of Sons. This is

Faith <hi>intitles,</hi> and Holineſs <hi>meetens:</hi> Both which, though

That in right of their Election.</p>
               <p>To put Effects in the place of Cauſes; and Cauſes, of
Effects; is a great abſurdity in <hi>Natural</hi> things: and yet,
how prone are we to it, in Matters of <hi>Divine</hi> Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment!
which chiefly comes from the <hi>pride</hi> of our Spirits;

than <hi>That</hi> which is <hi>proper</hi> to it. This is a <hi>Great Evil;</hi> and

               <p>The genuine Import of Scripture-Salvation, is broad and

which any way conduce to the perfect accompliſhment of

Salvation, what ever pertains to Bleſſedneſs and Glory; as

Any of which being abſent, would invalidate all the reſt;
As one Round of a Ladder pluck'd-out, hinders your aſcent

                  <p>The Jews had many Means of knowing the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi>

<hi>Rule</hi> by which the Diſpenſation is <hi>guided:</hi> It is <hi>Adequate</hi>

which Heaven and Earth do bow under: He that made

                  <p>And for the Elect themſelves, They are (of themſelves)

came to do, that He doth and will do; and that
None of His work ſhall fall to the ground. What He ſaith
in the 17 John, is prophetical of what He will ſay at the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
day; <hi>I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do;
Of all that Thou haſt given me, I have loſt Nothing; I

                  <p>All that God doth for Men, or Gives to them, in order
to their Salvation, is Given and Done <hi>freely.</hi> Now, a
thing is then ſaid to be <hi>thus</hi> Given or Done, when it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from the meer Good will and favour of Him that
Worketh, or Giveth; without reſpect to any thing done or

no obligation on him that gives, Nor attractive or oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  <p>Much need not be ſaid to proove the <hi>free-giving</hi> of the
things we are ſpeaking of, Did we duly conſider three
particulars:</p>
                  <p>1. The Sovereign Greatneſs of Him that gives; It is
the <hi>Moſt High God, Poſſeſſour of Heaven and Earth;</hi> Who
is Infinitely and Independently bleſſed in Himſelf; and
therefore, cannot be Added unto, nor Receive from any
Creature: Who can give to Him, that gives to <hi>All</hi> their
life and breath?</p>
                  <p>2. The ſuperexcellent, and unſpeakable worth of the
things that are Given: The firſt and Chief, is our Lord
Jeſus Chriſt; whoſe dignity is ſuch, That Heaven and
Earth are too low a price to ſet Him at; (eſpecially, To
be given as He was:) and in Him, Righteouſneſs and
Strength; Adoption and Reconciliation; Grace and
Glory.</p>
                  <p>3. The vanity and wretchedneſs of thoſe on whom they
are beſtowed: Both Scripture and Experience, ſpeak no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of them in their Naturals, but what beſpeaks a
Condition every way deplorable, and uncapable of yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Motives for ſuch a Gift; as is ſhewn afore.</p>
                  <p>But being ſo greatly in love with our ſelves, and fond of
our own improvements; and ſo ſtifly bent to a Covenant
of works: To help us off from thoſe dangerous bottoms,
let us dwell a while on the following Conſiderations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="178" facs="tcp:60927:93"/>
I. What is the Nature and Import of the <hi>Covenant</hi> of
<hi>Grace.</hi> This Covenant is that, which all profeſſing Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
profeſs to be ſaved by; how-ever they differ about the
Import and Latitude of it. But, if we receive the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Notion, (which needs muſt be the Righteſt) we ſhall
finde, That it is of the very Nature and Subſtance of this
Covenant, To give <hi>freely</hi> and <hi>abſolutely;</hi> without Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning
for anything to be done by Men, as the ground and
Motive thereof. <hi>All</hi> that God doth for thoſe He will
ſave, is <hi>for His Name ſake;</hi> which Name is recorded in
<hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 5 &amp; 6, <hi>The Lord God, Gracious and Merciful,</hi>
&amp;c. To be Gracious, is To doe well to one that deſerves
ill: And if otherwiſe, it would be but after the Covenant
of Works, or firſt Covenant: Which yet was not faulty
or defective in it ſelf; for it gave a ſufficiency to obtain the
benefits contained in it; which if they had uſed and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd
as they might, there would not have needed a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.
But, the Lord forknowing the Creature's mutabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and conſequently, what need there would be of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
kind of Power and Grace, than <hi>that Adam</hi> was Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
with; Did therefore determine of a ſecond; which
in <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 2, is called, <hi>The hope of Eternal life, which God
who cannot lye, promiſed before the World began.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is called the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> not onely as deſigning
the Glory of His Grace, in the ſaving of men; but as giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>freely,</hi> and of mere Grace and Favour, what-ever muſt
bring-about that Salvation: For, Where els can lye the
difference between the two Covenants? It cannot be in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the <hi>eaſineſs</hi> and <hi>difficulty,</hi> of the duties enjoyned by
either; For, Faith and Repentance are much more above
the compaſs of natural power, than to forbear the forbidden
Tree: But the difference lyes in this, That the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
conſiſts of <hi>better</hi> Promiſes; And, this <hi>Betterneſs</hi> ſtands
in the Free, Abſolute, Independent engagement of God
Himſelf, to Inveſt His Covenanted Ones, with all things
conducing to the Bleſſedneſs held forth; And that, as
well what is to be done on <hi>their</hi> part, as on <hi>His Own</hi> upon
their doing of it; That is, (plainly) To Give to them and
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:60927:93"/>
Work in them, <hi>Whatever</hi> in this Covenant He requires
of them. The law ſhews matter of Duty, but gives not
where-with to perform it; The Covenant of Grace does
both, by writing the law in the heart. And without this, it
would ſtill have been but a Covenant of <hi>works,</hi> be the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
enjoined whatever you will. It therefore runs not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Conditional</hi> or <hi>Failable</hi> terms, (I will [If] ye will:) but
<hi>Abſolute</hi> and <hi>Sovereign,</hi> [I will] and [ye ſhall.] This Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
does not only give life upon terms of Believing; but
Faith alſo and Holineſs, as the neceſſary means of attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that life: And this, not upon your ingenuous comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
(as ſome term it) or better improvement of what you
have in common with other Men; (ſuch allegations the
Lord diſallows, and often Cautions againſt,) but of <hi>Grace.</hi>
It's a Covenant made-up of <hi>Promiſes;</hi> and <hi>Promiſe</hi> (by
Scripture intendment) is alwayes <hi>Free;</hi> both freely <hi>made</hi>
and freely <hi>perform'd;</hi> without the deſert or procurement
of Men. Take Iſaac for inſtance; Abraham's body was now
dead;<note place="margin">Gen. 18. 11. ver. 14.</note> and Sarah, (beſides her natural barrenneſs) <hi>it ceaſed
to be with her after the manner of Women;</hi> and yet, <hi>Sarah
ſhall have a Son.</hi> But, How? The Promiſe had in it (though
Abraham and Sarah had not) whatever might tend to Iſaac's
conception and birth;<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 23, 28.</note> and for this cauſe, He was called <hi>The
Son of the Promiſe;</hi> as alſo <hi>Believers</hi> are, Rom. 9. 8. Gal. 3.
29. They are alſo termed, <hi>Heirs of Promiſe,</hi> Heb. 6. 17.
And, on this account, Chriſt is called The <hi>Promiſed Seed;</hi>
and the Holy Ghoſt, The <hi>Spirit of Promiſe.</hi> viz, To ſhew the
<hi>Independent freeneſs</hi> of thoſe Divine Gifts: The Promiſe
of ſending them; Their actual Coming; and Effectual o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations,
are all free, and free in all reſpects: This <hi>Dew
from the Lord waiteth not for Men.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mic. 5. 7.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>For further illuſtration, the Jews are a pertinent Inſtance,
as ye read in Jer. 32. from v. 30. to the 36. They had done
nothing but evil, from their youth up; and were a <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
provocation:</hi> And when ſcattered among the Nations,
they were no-whit bettered; but cauſed, even the Heathen
to blaſpheme: And yet, notwithſtanding all this, the Lord
<hi>will Gather them,</hi> and <hi>give them an heart to fear Him
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:60927:94"/>
for ever,</hi> v. 37. to v. 44.: And this, even whiles they
were not moved, <hi>neither could they bluſh,</hi> chap. 8. 12. See
alſo, with what inexpreſſible freeneſs of Grace, the Lord
deals with them, in Iſa. 43. v. 25. <hi>I, even I, am He that
blotteth out thy tranſgreſſions,—and will not remember thy ſins.</hi>
But, what's the Introduction to this ſo great a Promiſe?
See it, and wonder at it! <hi>Thou haſt not called upon Me, O
Jacob;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. v. 22. ver. 23. ver. 24.</note> but, thou haſt <hi>been weary of Me, O Iſrael: Thou
haſt not brought Me the ſmall Cattel of thy burnt Offerings;
Thou haſt bought Me no ſweet Cane with thy money;—but,
haſt made Me to ſerve with thy ſins,</hi> and <hi>wearied Me with
thine iniquities: I, even I</hi> (whom thou haſt dealt ſo ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
with,<note place="margin">Iſa. 64. 3.</note> and diſingenuouſly, even I) <hi>am He that blotteth
out thy tranſgreſſions, for mine own ſake.</hi> And this was a
<hi>Great</hi> thing they <hi>looked not for;</hi> As (indeed) conſidering
themſelves and what their demeanour had been, they had
no Reaſon to look for it.</p>
                  <p>Hence 'tis cleer, That <hi>Grace</hi> reſpects not the <hi>worthineſs</hi> of
<hi>Men</hi> in what It does for them; Nay, it muſt reſpect their
<hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nworthineſs</hi> rather, as that by which Grace is more illuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,
and the glory thereof more advanced; according to
Rom. 5. 20. <hi>Where ſin abounded, Grace did much more abound.</hi>
And Paul proclaims it as verified on himſelf, 1 Tim. 1. 13.
<hi>I was a Blaſphemer, and a Perſecutour, and Injurious: But
I obtained Mercy;—and the Grace of our Lord was [ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
abundant</hi>]—v. 14; and hereupon he falls to Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that Grace; <hi>Now, to the King Eternal, Immortal, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible,
the only wiſe God, be honour and Glory, for ever and
ever, Amen;</hi> v. 17.</p>
                  <p>The Riche<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of Mercy is made-out by <hi>Saving the Chief
of ſinners;</hi> and in <hi>quickening</hi> us <hi>when dead, Epheſ.</hi> 2. 1 &amp; 4.
And it is very obſervable, That the Apoſtles (when ever they
mention the Grace of God in <hi>Saving, Quickening, &amp;c.</hi>) do
not give the leaſt intimation of Mens <hi>Worthineſs, Prepared<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
Compliance,</hi> or any ſuch thing; but [<hi>Dead in Sins</hi>] and
[<hi>Quickening</hi>] come one in the neck of the other; as light
does upon darkneſs, which, in no ſort, induces the light, or
prepares the dark Earth or Ayr for it: as is abundantly
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:60927:94"/>
evident in all their Epiſtles. And how oft, (and in good
earneſt) does the Lord declare againſt all the pretenſions of
Men, as to their <hi>activeneſs</hi> in this Matter, in <hi>Iſaiah, Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
Ezekiel, Hoſea, &amp;c.</hi> And as a barr to thoſe pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<hi>The Holy People,</hi> He calls A <hi>People ſought-out;</hi> and, that
<hi>He is found of them that ſought Him not;</hi> with many others.
This I ſhall end, with a very obſervable Inſtance within my
own Memory: (and I bring it not in for proof, but Illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
I knew a Man, who when he came under convictions,
endeavoured with all his might to ſtifle them: His Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions
grew ſtronger, and he hardned himſelf againſt
them. He ſaw their tendency; but ſo oppoſite to it, that
he reſolv'd in expreſs terms, [He would not be a Puritan,
what-ever came of it.] To the Church he muſt go; (His
Maſter would have it ſo:) But, this was his wont, To loll
o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>r the ſeat, with his fingers in both his ears; (Here, <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi>
or <hi>Conditional</hi> Grace was (ſurely) non-plus'd). But a
Choſen Veſſel muſt not ſo be loſt; Now ſteps-in <hi>Electing
Grace,</hi> and by a caſual ſlip of his Elbows, drew-out the
ſtoppers, and ſent-in a Word, (from the Pulpit) which,
like fire from Heaven, melted his heart, and caſt it in a
New Mould. Surely, in this, the Lord did not wait for
the Man's complyance or improvements; His work was
not Originated <hi>thence,</hi> nor dependent thereon.</p>
                  <p>II.<note place="margin">II.</note> If all that <hi>pertains</hi> to Salvation were not given <hi>freely,</hi>
Salvation it ſelf ſhould not be of Grace: For, <hi>to him that

And that is, Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; of whom it is ſaid,

Record in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>It ſhall bruiſe thy head:</hi> Which
words doe contain an Abſolute, free Promiſe to ſend the
Son of God in the Nature of Man, to be a Redeemer. And we
evidently know, That His <hi>actual</hi> coming and performance
thereof, was not ſuſpended upon any good thing to be done
by Men: How could it, when after the Fall, they did not
nor could doe any thing, but what might turn His heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="183" facs="tcp:60927:95"/>
For evidence hereof, We need not go out of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text;
Doe but obſerve the Firſt <hi>Adam's</hi> Carriage, and the
Manner of it, juſt afore the Promiſe was made: Firſt, They
believe the Serpent rather than God; Then they break the
Commandment of life, when they had neither need nor oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
ſo to do. This done, and finding themſelves loſt, they
do not ſo much as <hi>ſeek</hi> after God for help, but rather to <hi>hide</hi>
themſelves from Him: ſo farr from confeſſing themſelves
faulty, that they charge God fooliſhly, and ſhift the
blame of their miſcarriage upon Him; <hi>The woman whom</hi>
[Thou] <hi>gaveſt to be with me, ſhe gave me of the Tree</hi>—And
<hi>the Serpent</hi> (which alſo is a Creature of thy Making) <hi>he
beguiled me</hi> &amp;c. Here's nothing in their deportment, that
looks <hi>like</hi> the Motive of ſuch a Promiſe. But, tho they
Run from God, He will not ſo part with them; yea, He
follows them, finds them out, and for a door of hope
<hi>freely</hi> pronounceth this gracious Promiſe, of ſending One
to deſtroy this old ſerpent, the Devil; and conſequently
the Serpentine Nature, that had now inſtill'd and Mingled
it ſelf with theirs. It is the firſt promulgation of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
and ſpeaks with as much abſoluteneſs as words can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs,
<hi>It [Shall] bruiſe thy head.</hi> This I ſhall ſtand the more
upon, becauſe it is the <hi>Firſt</hi> that was made in <hi>Time,</hi> and
<hi>That</hi> out of which, all <hi>following</hi> Promiſes are educed.</p>
                  <p>The intent of this Promiſe, was <hi>Adam's</hi> Recovery and
Comfort; who (doubtleſs) at this time, was in a very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolate
Condition, as lying under a freſh ſenſe of the
happineſs he had loſt, and the wofull eſtate he was now
plunged into: And therefore, 'twas neceſſary, (if <hi>Adam</hi>
ſhall have Comfort by it) that the terms thereof be
altogether free and Abſolute. For, ſuppoſe them to be
Conditional, as, (namely) If <hi>Adam</hi> ſhall now repent and
Convert himſelf; If he ſhall better improve a ſecond ſtock;
(or rather, the cankered Remnant of that he had at firſt,)
My Son <hi>Then</hi> ſhall come into this lower World, to ſtill that
Enemy and Avenger; His life ſhall go for thy life, I will be
friends with thee, and reſtore thee to thy firſt Eſtate. All
this, and more of this kind, had yielded but little comfort or
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:60927:96"/>
hope to a guilty and defiled Conſcience; who found himſelf
not onely naked and wholly bereft of his Primitive Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs;
but at enmity with his Creatour, and a bondſlave to
Satan: For, ſuch Reaſonings as theſe, would have broke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
like a floud, to bear-down and ſtifle all hopes of future
ſucceſs; viz. If when I was in ſo bleſſed a ſtate, and endued
with power to keep it; upon ſo ſlight a temptation I yeil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and fell; How ſhould I Riſe now I am down and my
ſtrength is gon? If when I had freedom of Will and ſtood
upright, ſo eaſily I warp'd into crooked paths; How can I
hope to Return and do better, now my Will is perverted,
and bent to a contrary courſe? If whilſt I had eyes in my
head, and ſaw things with cleerneſs, I yet loſt my way and
wandred; How ſhould I think to recover it, being now
both ſadly bewildred, and my eyes put-out? How ſhould
I bring a clean thing out of an unclean, who kept not my
heart clean when it was ſo? How ſhould I gain more with
fewer talents, who ran my ſelf out of all when I had
abundantly more? Grapes will not grow upon Thorns, nor
Figgs on Thiſtles: Nay, were my Primitive'ſtate reſtored
agen, on the former terms; I could not expect to keep it,
having this wofull experience of ſo cauſleſs and dreadfull an
Apoſtacy, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>It was therefore importantly neceſſary, that this firſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
made upon ſo great and ſolemn an occaſion, and
bearing in it all the hopes and comforts of God's People to
Eternity; ſhould be <hi>thorowly free and abſolute,</hi> and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
(in the leaſt) upon any good thing to be done by Men,
as a condition of it.</p>
                  <p>And if Chriſt be given <hi>freely,</hi> there's good ground of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing
thence, the free-giving of <hi>leſſer</hi> things; as doth the
Apoſtle in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8, <hi>He that ſpared not His Son, how ſhall He
not with Him freely give us all things?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Math. 6. 25.</note> 
                     <hi>Is not the life more
than meat?</hi> Is not Chriſt more than Faith and all Grace?
Has God given us the fleſh of His Son, which is Meat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed;
and will He not reſtore our withered hand to receive
it? It cannot be; eſpecially conſidering, That <hi>this</hi> may be
done with a <hi>Word;</hi> and without <hi>This,</hi> the Other would be
loſt, and as water ſpilt on the ground.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="185" facs="tcp:60927:96"/>
But, though this Promiſe of Chriſt, be virtually a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
of all Grace; yet, becauſe of our ſlowneſs of heart to
believe, and to win us off from our legallizing Notions; the
Lord condeſcends to gratify His People in <hi>Words</hi> as well as
<hi>Subſtance:</hi> And therefore,</p>
                  <p>V. To make it expreſly evident, that all Spiritual bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
are <hi>perfectly free,</hi> He hath put them all into <hi>Abſolute</hi>
Promiſes.</p>
                  <p>Not that all Promiſes run in that tenor: Many of them
have Conditions annex'd; which alſo (in their place) are
of very ſignificant uſefullneſs:<note place="margin">Gen. 22. 12-18. Joh. 3. 16. chap. 14. 6. Math. 5. 8. 2 Cor. 7. 1. Mark. 16. 16. Joh. 10. 9.</note> 1. As proofs of our willing
Subjection to God. 2. Directives by what Mediums we
muſt get-to the Bleſſedneſs deſign'd us. 3. How we muſt
be qualified for the enjoyment of it. 4. As Marks and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences
of our being in the way to it; and of thoſe to
whom it doth belong. But, this Annexion of Conditions,
does not imply a power in Men to perform them; (tho'
perform'd they muſt be, before we enjoy the promiſed
Good;) Nor does the effect of thoſe Promiſes depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any Act to be done by us, which ſome other Promiſe doth
not provide us with. But,</p>
                  <p>That Great Fundamental Promiſe, on which is founded
<hi>our hopes of Eternal life,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tit. 1. 2.</note> was <hi>Abſolute;</hi> ('twas <hi>given afore
the world;</hi>) Though dearly conditional to Him with whom
the Compact was made; yet perfectly free and Abſolute to
us: And therefore the adding of Conditions to After-Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
may not be taken as invalidating that <hi>Firſt</hi> Promiſe,
Or as a Defeazance to it: It's a Scripture Maxim, That <hi>the
Covenant which was before confirmed of God in Chriſt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>the
Law which was Four hundred and thirty years after, cannot
diſannul; that it ſhould make the Promiſe of none effect.</hi> The
like may be ſaid of Promiſes made <hi>in Time;</hi> viz, That the
<hi>Conditionalneſs of Some; does not make-void the Abſoluteneſs
of Others.</hi> As the <hi>Law</hi> was to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſuch are <hi>Conditional</hi>
Promiſes to the <hi>Abſolute;</hi> They ſhew what we ſhould be
and do, and (by conſequence) that we can neither be nor do
as we ſhould; and thence Inferr, The Neceſſity of Divine
Grace to undertake for us: And then (indeed) is the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:60927:97"/>
of Grace adorable, which promiſeth help in terms of
an Abſolute tenor. And accordingly we find, That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is, in one Scripture, made the Condition of Accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
with God, and Eternal life; In other Scriptures thoſe
very Conditions are promiſed without Condition: Some
of which we have a Proſpect of in the following bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance.</p>

is, To raze or interline a Record; which is a <hi>Felonious

               <p>There be three ſorts of Compulſion; Violent, Natural,
and Rational.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Violent;</hi> when a Man is conſtrain'd to <hi>do</hi> That which
his <hi>Will</hi> is <hi>oppoſite</hi>-to. Thus the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to ſerve the
<hi>Egyptians,</hi> and to go into Captivity: So alſo <hi>Paul</hi>
and other Saints are led captive to That they would not:<note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note>
By this kind of Compulſion it is, that Satan is caſt-out,
(as is proved afore:) But, the <hi>Will,</hi> in Converſion,
comes not under this kind of Conſtraint; Nor any thing
like it.</p>
               <p>2. There is a <hi>Natural</hi> Compulſion; Thus Men and
other Creatures are Compelled to Eat, Drink, Sleep,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:60927:104"/>
and breathe: There needs no violent hand to inforce
it, nor (indeed) Arguments to perſwade to it;
They do it by Inſtinct, which God hath endued them
with, for their own Conſervation: This is proper to the Soul
Converted.</p>
               <p>3. There is alſo a <hi>Rational</hi> Compulſion; (which is near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
the Caſe in hand:) This is, when the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Judgment are <hi>Convinced</hi> of the Goodneſs, Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,
or Expediency of a Thing; which before he judged
<hi>otherwiſe</hi> of.<note place="margin">Luke 15. 17. 2 King. 7. 3, 4.</note> For this, ſee the <hi>Prodigal</hi>'s Reaſons for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
to his Father; and the <hi>Lepers,</hi> for going to the <hi>Syri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
Camp: Their Reaſon told them, It was better to go
where there was hope, than tarry where there was None.
See alſo the Arguments for the Saints living to Chriſt;
<hi>His Love conſtrains them;</hi> yet no breach of their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty;
albeit, that Ere-while they were Otherwiſe
minded.</p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe, (<hi>viz.</hi> That which is <hi>violent</hi>) our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
hath nothing to do with. It is true, There is a <hi>Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
in Converſion; and there would be no Converſion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it;<note place="margin">Joh. 6. 44.</note> 
                  <hi>No Man can come to Chriſt except he be Drawn:</hi>
Which <hi>Drawing</hi> implies, either an <hi>Averſneſs,</hi> or (at leaſt) a
<hi>Diſability,</hi> in him that is <hi>Drawn;</hi> and conſequently, a kind
of <hi>force,</hi> or <hi>extrinſecal Power</hi> put-forth upon him: But let
me ſay, It is <hi>ſuch a Force,</hi> as the enlightened Soul moſt glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſujects it ſelf unto; and would not be from under the
power and bleſſed Influence of it, for a World. Let it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be obſerv'd, <hi>How</hi> the Father draws; It is, in the moſt
Genuine and kindly way that can be conceiv'd; He draws
by <hi>Teaching:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 6. 45. Judg. 8. 16. Exod. 5. 16.</note> Not as <hi>Gideon</hi> taught the Men of <hi>Succoth;</hi>
Nor as the Task-Maſters drew the people to their burdens:
But, as <hi>Jacob</hi> was drawn into <hi>Egypt;</hi> who need not be <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced</hi>
to diſlodge and remove his Tent, when he found himſelf
ſurrounded with famine, and heard there was corn in <hi>Egypt;</hi>
That the King had ſent Wagons for him,<note place="margin">Gen. 45.</note> and proviſions for
the way; telling him withall, That the Good of all the land
was before him: Eſpecially conſidering, that his beloved
<hi>Ioſeph</hi> was there alive, and in greateſt honour, ready to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:60927:104"/>
him. In like manner, When the Soul hath a ſight of
the Holineſs of God, and of its own Vileneſs; Of the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
Streightneſs, and juſt ſeverity, of the law; With its
own Uncleanneſs, Crookedneſs, Guiltineſs, and Diſability
to bear the Vengeance of it: That, in God alone is all its
bleſſedneſs: and that yet, it cannot poſſibly come at him,
but as dry'd Stubble to a Devouring flame. And yet agen, If
he comes not, he dyes in the place where he is, and muſt
dwell with everlaſting burnings; And withall hears of a
<hi>Mediatour</hi> who caſts out None that come to Him; and by
whom he may come to God both ſafely and acceptably;
There will need no violent hand on the Will; Even <hi>love to
himſelf will make the Soul Wings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is, indeed, a violent (or rather, Almighty) Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint
and Caſting-out of him that did uſurp upon the Will,
&amp; pervert it, by deluding the underſtanding with falſe gloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
and Carnal Reaſonings; Which being diſpelled by the
true Light's ſhining, the Will falls-in with it, and follows
with perfect freedom. Chriſt offer'd no violence to the <hi>Man,</hi>
when He caſt-out the legion, but thereby reſtor'd him to his
proper freedom;<note place="margin">Luke 8. 35.</note> For, We preſently find him <hi>at Jeſus feet
Clothed and in his Right Minde;</hi> Deſiring <hi>Now</hi> to dwell
with Him, the Sight of whom (before) was a torment to
him.</p>
               <p>The Underſtanding (when the faculties are put in order
by Renovation) is the ſpirit of the Will, which therefore
looks and goes the ſame way, as of Courſe, (as the wheeles
did after the living-Creatures)<note place="margin">Ezek. 1. 19.</note> without any forreign or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Conſtraint: It hath <hi>Now</hi> a Spring within it, by which
it is Moved and Guided (it ſelf being alſo Renewed and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified)
according to this Renewed Light: As a Needle, that
is rightly touch'd, Needs not be fore'd to look towards the
Pole;<note place="margin">Matth. 6. 22.</note> It will do it by Sympathy: <hi>If the eye be ſingle, the
whole body is full of light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, ſuppoſe the thing objected to be true; (Namely,
That in Converſion, the Will ſuffereth violence;) It no way
deſerves to be Styled <hi>Cruel</hi> or <hi>Tyranical</hi> (as ſome (extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tender in Nature's Concerns) do preſume to ſpeak;) Nor
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:60927:105"/>
(indeed) to be complained of, in the leaſt; Since the tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and iſſue thereof is an Infinite good. Was it not a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to <hi>Jeremy,</hi> That <hi>the Word of the Lord was as fire in his
bones, that he could not forbear ſpeaking;</hi> rather than be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
for holding his peace? How much better is it, To
enter into life halt or maymed, than go into hell with a
whole skin! I hope, there is none ſo much beſides them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
as to judge otherwiſe of it; Or complain of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
compell'd to go to Heaven, tho it were by a Whirle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind
and Charet of fire. At <hi>firſt,</hi> (I grant) tis pure neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
drives to Chriſt; but <hi>Afterwards,</hi> His perſonal Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
and Lovelineſs conſtrain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to abide with Him; (A
Sweet and Bleſſed Compulſion!) And now you would not
leave Him agen, although the firſt neceſſity of your going to
Him were quite at an end.</p>
               <p>But ſtill we ſay, (as before) That the Will is not viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
but changed: and that in a due and orderly way, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
made ſubject to an enlightened Underſtanding; Than
which, there is nothing more pleaſant and Natural to it.</p>
               <p>Now, As touching Inferences upon this Doctrine, I reduce
them to two ſorts: 1 <hi>Cautionary,</hi> To prevent the Miſuſing ſo
Great a truth: 2 <hi>Directive,</hi> to draw-forth ſome of the ſpirits
of it, into practice: And of theſe, Intermixedly and Briefly
(though capable of much enlargement.)</p>
               <p>In General; Take notice, That the ſcope and deſigne of
the Doctrine, is not to foſter Remiſsneſs in Duty; Nor to
Countenance a ſtupid or carnal quiet: But, to ſet forth the
Fullneſs Freeneſs and Prevalent efficacy of Divine Grace;
With the Creatur's nothingneſs (as to any conſiderable Act)
in this Matter. More particularly:</p>
               <p>I.<note place="margin">I.</note> Preſume not your ſelf Intereſſed in the Promiſe of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
life, untill you find in your Self thoſe neceſſary Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Qualifications of Faith and Regeneration: Or at leaſt,
a truly earneſt and reſtleſs purſuit after them; I <hi>will not
let Thee go except Thou bleſs me.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 32. 26. II.</note>
               </p>
               <p>II. Let not the Means be deſpiſed, becauſe of themſelves
not Sufficient to ſave: Where the Means are, the Lord
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:60927:105"/>
expects that Men ſhould uſe them; and we read not of any
Saved without, where they might be had.</p>
               <p>III.<note place="margin">III.</note> Let no Man ſit ſtill in the wilfull or careleſs neglect
of his duty; pretending, That if Elected, he ſhall ſurely be
Saved; If not, all he can do will not help him: Such a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
argues a great height of Pride, or Sullenneſs of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and Enmity againſt God: Fly from it as from Hell; It
is truly that Death which Hell follows after. As on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
ye can hardly have a more hopefull ſymptom of your
State, than a ſerious attendance upon God in His way: And
in ſeeking to know your Election, begin at the Right End;
Give all diligence to make your Calling ſure; and the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of your Election will fall-in upon it.</p>
               <p>IV.<note place="margin">IV.</note> Take notice (from the Import and Tenor of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Doctrine) what ſtanding need and uſefulneſs there is
of thoſe often repeated Cautions, To <hi>Try the ſpirits; Search
the Scriptures; Take heed how you hear;</hi> and Not to be led by
<hi>fair ſhews in the fleſh;</hi> (which is, to be caught with chaff.)
The more ſmooth and pleaſing notions are to the carnal Ear,
the more to be ſuſpected, and throughly examined before
they paſs. Let the Drift of the Law and teſtimony deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the Queſtion; And that will tell you, Thoſe Doctrines
are not to be held guiltleſs, that cry-up that Excellent Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

the ſufficiency of Free-will-Grace; (and truly I know
not what; For they are not after the patern of wholſom

(that glorious Deſign) of Grace in Election, The Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation
of Chriſt, and the Holy Ghoſt's operations, muſt
all hang and Move; yea be fruſtate too, and come to nothing;
except the Reaſon of Man will dethrone it ſelf, and ſubmit

OR
The certain and effectual Progreſs
of Election.</head>
            <p>FOR the firmer ſupport and comfort of Believers, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the preſent weakneſs of their Faith;
As alſo, to allure and bring-in Others, who are han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kering
about the door, or yet in the high-wayes and
hedges; It hath pleaſed the Holy and only Wiſe God, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge
us with plain and poſitive aſſurance of the certain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
and going-on, of <hi>All</hi> who have <hi>once</hi> believed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the Grace of God in truth; Albeit, that many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
in this aſſurance, attain not to it.</p>
            <p>That Faith and Holineſs do inſeperably follow Election,
is ſhewn afore: Our buſineſs now is to ſhew, that Faith and
Holineſs are of an abiding nature, and ſhall never be loſt: And
this is <hi>that</hi> we call PERSEVERANCE. Which being the
<hi>Crown</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> of all the former Points; and that as ſecures
to us the comforts ariſing thence; being alſo as much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned
as any of Thoſe: the proof and confirmation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
is apparently neceſſary, and tending to profit: And I
truſt, it ſhall not onely appear, that the Doctrine is <hi>True;</hi>
but alſo replete with Arguments promotive of Holineſs;
by which, the contrary opinion will beſt be contradicted:
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:60927:110"/>
For, ſo it is, in the Wiſdom of God, that every Truth has
<hi>that</hi> in it, as properly tends to its own defenſe and eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment.</p>
            <p>It's the property of Men truly wiſe, to enterpriſe onely
attainable things, and things worthy their wiſdom; as alſo, ſo
to frame and module the <hi>means,</hi> as not to miſs their intent:
Much more muſt it become, and be incumbent upon Him
who is Wiſdom it ſelf, ſo to do: If, then, the Ultimate
End of all things, be the Glory of God; and the ſecond great
End, the Salvation of His Choſen: It may well be concluded,
that the propereſt means for attainment, are pitched upon;
and thoſe, ſuch as will compaſs his End. Hence alſo, we
may be ſatisfied, that all intermediate Occurrences. (How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
improper in their own nature, and <hi>caſual</hi> to us,)
were all fore-appointed of God, and that by a Decree moſt
wiſe and fixed; and conſequently, are and ſhall be ſo diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
as not to hinder, but help-on and bring-about, the thing
principally deſign'd; which therefore ſhall not (<hi>cannot</hi>) miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry,
nor be <hi>finally</hi> diſturbed.</p>
            <p>However therefore,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 2. 17.</note> Men of corrupt minds may ſtumble
at the Word, Change the Truth of God into a lye, and turn
his Grace into laſciviouſneſs; and ſome others, (not of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
but) by miſtake and unacquaintedneſs with the true ſtate
of the Queſtion; may diſapprove and object againſt it: Yet
may not the Truth be diſcarded, nor its friends be ſhy to
Own it; But ſtrive the more induſtriouſly, by their Sobriety,
Meekneſs, Holineſs, and all good fruits, to make the World
know; that <hi>To the Pure all things are pure;</hi> whiles to other
Men (through the impurity of their own ſpirits) all things
are defiled, and turned into ſin: And in particular, that the
Doctrine of God's unchangeable love to his Choſen, and their
Endleſs abiding therein, is no way an inle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Towards the Evidenceing of this Truth, 1. let us take-in
things of a <hi>lower</hi> conſideration, than that of Eternal Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and ſee, how thoſe perſons (formerly inſtanced) being
deſtined of God to eminent ſervice in the World, were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried

Notwithſtanding the greateſt difficulties and natural impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities,

a little) to illuſtrate the Truth in hand.</p>
               <p>1. I begin with <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſeed: In <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 7. The land
of <hi>Canaan</hi> is given them by Promiſe: <hi>Iſaac,</hi> in whom this
Seed ſhould be called, was not yet born; Nor yet, untill both
his Parents were paſt age.<note place="margin">Gen. 18. 11.</note> To help this, the Lord brings<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back
the Sun many degrees; makes it a new ſpring-time with
them, and gives them <hi>Iſaac.</hi> When <hi>Iſaac</hi> was Married,
his wife proves barren:<note place="margin">chap. 25. 21. verſe 23.</note> After twenty years waiting, the
Lord (in anſwer to prayer) gives her Conception. Now,
two Children they had; the Elder of which, the Lord rejects;
and the other, (to whom the Promiſe belong'd) in danger e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
day to be killed by his Brother; and ſo, the line of the
Promiſe in danger of failing.<note place="margin">chap. 27. 41. chap. 28. 2. chap. 31. 41. v. 23. and 24.</note> 
                  <hi>Jacob,</hi> to ſave his life, flies to
<hi>Padan-Aram;</hi> there <hi>Laban</hi> deals hardly with him; and when
he made homewards, follows him with evil intent: But, the
Lord in a dream takes him off. No ſooner is he eſcap'd from
him,<note place="margin">chap. 32. 6.</note> but <hi>Eſau</hi> comes againſt him with four hundred Men, full
bent to revenge the old grudge: The Lord turns his heart in
a moment,<note place="margin">chap. 33. 4. v. 12.</note> and melts him into brotherly affection; that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of deſtroying <hi>Jacob,</hi> he proffers himſelf to be his Guard
and Convoy. When <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> had ſo highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
the <hi>Canaanites,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">chap. 34. 25. chap. 35. 5.</note> that it was a Thouſand to One but
they would come and cut off <hi>Jacob's</hi> family at once; the Lord
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:60927:111"/>
cauſes a terrour to fall upon them, that they do not ſo much
as look after them. When a ſeven years Famine was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the land;<note place="margin">ch. 37. 28. with chap. 41. 54.</note> (likely enough to eat up poor <hi>Jacob</hi> and his

to make proviſion for them in <hi>Egypt.</hi> When oppreſt by the
<hi>Egyptians,</hi> and all means uſed to deſtroy them, and that both
with craft and cruelty;<note place="margin">Exod. 1. 12.</note> the Lord ſo orders the Matter, that the
more they were oppreſſed, the faſter they grew; and by an
high hand brings them out at laſt.</p>
               <p>In the Wilderneſs, they carry themſelves as unworthily
towards God, as ever People did; doing all that in them lay
to cut off the intail of that good land, by their unbelief, and
dayly repeated Rebellions; inſomuch that the Lord threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens
to diſpoſſeſs them: But, for his Promiſe ſake made with
<hi>Abraham,</hi> withdraws his hand and ſpares them.</p>
               <p>I might inſtance alſo, the great ſtreights and dangers they
were in at the <hi>Red-Sea,</hi> which the Lord divided for them;
Afterwards for want of water, which he brings them out of a

How they were denied paſſage by ſome, and way-laid
by Others; and yet carried on and delivered: and at laſt, how
the Lord drove out thoſe Gyants, whom they deſpaired of
Overcoming; and ſo gave them the land in poſſeſſion, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his promiſe hundreds of years afore: <hi>There failed not

which in ſeveral dreams he intimates to him: His bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren

(which ſignified their ſubjection to him) they conſpire to
kill him:<note place="margin">v. 18.</note> And how ſhall <hi>Joſeph</hi> eſcape? They are ten to one

<pb n="213" facs="tcp:60927:111"/>
by in the very nick of time, ere any wild beaſt ſhall have found
him, or his brethren determin'd worſe againſt him: To them
they ſell him, and by them he is brought into <hi>Egypt,</hi> (far e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
out of <hi>Jacobs</hi> inquiry) and ſold to the Captain of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>'s

favour makes all that he doth, to proſper: which his Maſter
obſerving, puts the management of all his eſtate into <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s

But,<note place="margin">v. 7.</note> how ſoon is it daſh'd! <hi>Joſeph</hi> being a goodly perſon, his

with,<note place="margin">Pſ. 105. 18.</note> that <hi>The Iron entred into his ſoul.</hi> Now, all hopes of
preferment are gon, and what will become of his dreams?
Yet ſtill, the Councel of the Lord, that ſhall ſtand; and this
downfal of <hi>Joſeph,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 40.</note> ſhall prove another ſtep to his riſing: And
to make way for it, two of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Servants ſhall fall under
their Lord's diſpleaſure, be put in priſon, and committed to
<hi>Joſeph</hi>'s keeping: Here they ſhall dream; <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſhall inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret,
and the event ſhall anſwer it. Now the day begins agen
to dawn upon <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and by the chief Butlers reſtorement,

caſt a Javelin at him (unſuſpected,) to nail him to the Wall; a

they ſhall do likewiſe: yea, <hi>Saul</hi> himſelf ſhall turn prophet

and Death it ſelf, do attend him in every place. If they
lye in wait for him at <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> and watch the gates night
and day,<note place="margin">Acts 9. 23-25.</note> to kill him; he ſhall be let-down by the Wall in a
basket, and ſo eſcape them: If all <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> be in an uproar
to kill him; the chief Captain ſhall come with an Army and
reſcue him,<note place="margin">chap. 21. 31-33</note> (tho' no friend to <hi>Paul,</hi> nor to his Cauſe:) If
more than Fourty Men have bound themſelves with an oath,
that they will neither eat nor drink, till they have kill'd him;
his kinſman ſhal hear of it,<note place="margin">Acts 23. 14, 23</note> and by his means the chief Captain
ſhall be his friend agen, and grant him a ſufficient Convoy;
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:60927:112"/>
and this attempt ſhall be an occaſion of ſending him to <hi>Rome,</hi>
where his laſt teſtimony is to be given. If Jews and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
make an aſſault together, to uſe him deſpitefully and
to ſtone him; he ſhall be aware of it, and by fleeing ſave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
(by which means alſo the Goſpel ſhall be further
ſpread.)<note place="margin">Acts. 14. 5, 6.</note> But, ſuppoſe he be left in their hands; and they ſo
farr prevail, as to ſtone him, and drag him out of the City;
then (ſure) his work's at an end? No, All this ſhall not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
Death it ſelf ſhall not ſeperate <hi>Paul</hi> from his work.<note place="margin">ch. 16. 19, 20.</note> It
is not his being <hi>twice ſtoned,</hi> nor his <hi>thrice ſuffering Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wreck,</hi>
Nor his <hi>being in deaths often,</hi> nor any thing elſe,
that ſhall make-void the purpoſe of God for his bearing wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Chriſt at <hi>Rome;</hi> as is abundantly evident by the ſtories
of him, and the event at laſt.</p>
               <p>Other inſtances might be produced, to the ſame effect;
But, by theſe we may take an eſtimate of the thing under
proof; and rationally infer, that if the Lord be ſo exact and
punctual, in performing his word touching theſe leſſer
things; carrying on His work through ſuch a preaſs of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
oppoſitions; much more will He be, in ſecuring and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
about the Eternal welfare of his Choſen: That as he dealt
by His People of old; <hi>He bear them upon Eagles wings,</hi> (above
the Reach of danger) and <hi>kept them as the Apple of His eye;</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Deut. 32. 10.</note>
(with all poſſible care and tenderneſs) <hi>untill He had brought
them to Himſelf:</hi> So will He carry it towards His Elect; For,
he values the World but little, ſave with reſpect to them</p>
               <p>II. Now, for a more direct proof of the Doctrine: Though
two or three Witneſſes might ſuffice to eſtabliſh it; yet,
ſince the Scriptures do abound with Teſtimonies for it; (the
Collection whereof may be uſeful to us, for helping our faith
in times of obſcurity and danger: as alſo, to fortifie againſt
the aſſaults of ſuch as teach final Apoſtacy) I am ſomwhat the
larger in bringing them together; with ſome of thoſe Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine
Deductions that flow from them.</p>
               <p>In the Old Teſtament, are many Petitions and Reſolves
made by holy Men, which import the truth of this Doctrine;
As, (namely) That <hi>the Lord will perfect that which concerns
them:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſ. 138. 8.</note> That <hi>He will not for ſake the work of His own hands:</hi> That
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:60927:113"/>
                  <hi>He will guide them by His Councells,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſ. 73. 24.</note> and <hi>after receive them to
Glory:</hi> And that, in the mean time, <hi>None of their ſteps ſhall
ſlide;</hi> and this, becauſe <hi>It is God that girds them with
ſtrength, and He will make their way perfect, Pſalm</hi> 18. 32.
(with many others,<note place="margin">37. 31. 26. 1.</note> as alſo in <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles.) In every of
which is implyed a Promiſe of the thing prayed for, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
upon: For, without ſuch a Promiſe they could not
have done it in faith; nor meetly have given them down as
matter of inſtruction to Others. But, we know they ſpake
as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt;<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 21.</note> Who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

of the <hi>Genuine property</hi> of God's wayes; which is, to afford

<hi>The Righteous ſhall hold-on his way, and He that [hath] clean

loſe it: For, to ſay, He ſhall keep it, if he do not loſe
it, (as ſome would give the ſenſe) had been a Comfortleſs

This is yet further confirmed by <hi>John</hi> 5. 24, <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth

and break themſelves againſt; But never the Rock it ſelf,
nor <hi>That</hi> which is built upon it: <hi>He that truſteth in the
Lord, is as Mount Zion, which [cannot] be moved:</hi> No,
<hi>Not ſo much as One of the ſtakes of that Tabernacle ſhall be

               <p>It would very much allay that ſuperlative cauſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing,
[<hi>That our Names are written in Heaven,</hi>] If poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
they might be blotted out agen; ſince we find in our ſelves
ſuch a proneneſs to Revolt, (which every one acquainted
with his own heart, muſt acknolwedge:) But we are ſure,
Chriſt would not propound to us a <hi>failable</hi> ground of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing:
For, that would have been an inviting us to lean on
a breakable ſtaff: which kind of dependence, He is ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
calling us from.</p>
               <p>Believers (indeed) are ſometimes foyl'd, but never over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come:
Though they fall, (and that ſeaven times in a day,
as was ſaid) As often do they riſe agen: And it's no diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
to their leader, (yea, it is the Glory of a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral)
to give his enemy advantages, and take them agen at
his pleaſure, to his enemies greater confuſion and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw.
Satan got nothing by his Winnowing <hi>Peter;
Peter</hi> loſt ſome of his Chaff, (which well might be ſpared)
and the Tempter loſt many an after-advantage; For, the
World of Believers have been the warier ever ſince.</p>
               <p>To this ſecond ſort of evidence, I ſhall onely add <hi>That</hi> of
the Holy Apoſtle, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. He was perſwaded (that is, He
was throughly ſwayed in his faith, to believe it for himſelf,
and deliver it down to the Ages to come, as a Truth infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble)
That <hi>neither Height nor Depth, Nor any other Creature
ſhall be able to ſeparate from the love of God which is in Chriſt
Jeſus our Lord.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 38, 39.</note> He reckons up all that can be named; and,
leſt any thing might have ſlipt him, he brings in <hi>Height</hi>
and <hi>Depth;</hi> as being thoſe two extreams that take in All,
and more than Men can think: and then reſolves, That even
<hi>Theſe</hi> ſhal not be able to do it. And ſurely, if the ſuper-celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
height of God's <hi>Holineſs,</hi> Nor the infra-infernal Depth of
<hi>ſin,</hi> ſhall ſeparate from that day of Glory, (which the ſons
of God were Predeſtinated to, and for which they were

both made and Redeemed, called into and groan for;) then

               <head>III. A third ſort of evidence for Confirmation,
are certain Arguments or Reaſons why the
Saints muſt needs Perſevere in Faith and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.</head>
               <p>By this word [Needs muſt] I do not underſtand any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
kind of neceſſity, than well conſiſts with <hi>perfect freedom;
ſuch a</hi> Neceſſity as was upon <hi>Paul</hi> to preach the Goſpel;
which was a work he rejoyced in: ſuch as was upon Jeſus
Chriſt to bring-home his ſheep; and to lay down his life for
them:<note place="margin">Luke 12. 50.</note> How was He <hi>ſtreightned</hi> till it was accompliſhed!
That it was written in his heart was no hindrance to the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of his will: The expreſſion is well warranted alſo where
it is ſaid, That the Scripture (ſpeaking of <hi>Judas</hi> his fact)
<hi>muſt needs</hi> be fulfilled, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 16.</p>
               <p>The firſt Argument,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> I.</note>
                  <note place="margin">John 1. 13.</note> in proof of Perſeverance, is founded
on the Saints <hi>Extract</hi> or <hi>Original; They are born of God:</hi>
And this hath the force of a double Argument.</p>
               <p>1. As <hi>God is their Father and Eternal Root:</hi> Our Saviour
holds forth this Relation, as the ground of our Faith in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<hi>Math.</hi> 6. 9. And He begins with it Himſelf, when He
prayes for His own Glory, and that His Diſciples might be
partakers of it, <hi>John</hi> 17. 1. To the ſame end, He frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
uſeth that ſtyle of <hi>Father,</hi> in the Goſpel of <hi>John;</hi> as in
particular, That He aſcends to <hi>His Father, and our Father,
John</hi> 20. 17. It is to ſtrengthen our Faith in God (thro'
Himſelf) on the account of His <hi>Fatherhood</hi> to us. <hi>The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
loveth the Son, John</hi> 3. 35. And, <hi>He loves His Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
as He loveth Chriſt Himſelf, Iohn</hi> 17. 23. On which
ground the Apoſtle concludes, That <hi>He cannot but give us all
things elſe, Rom.</hi> 8. 32. Believers are, (in truth) the <hi>product</hi>
of His love, both in reſpect of <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Regeneration;</hi>
and being ſo, He cannot but have a paternal affection for
them; to adminiſter to them, what-ever tends to their
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:60927:115"/>
ſuſtentation and growth; and to keep-off what ever would
intercept or weaken His gracious influences towards them:
<hi>Having once loved them,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 13. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>He loves them for ever.</hi> They may
therefore be confident, That <hi>what He hath begun in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
He will not let end in the fleſh: That having begun a good
work in them,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 1. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>He will alſo perform it:</hi> For, As they have
their ſpiritual Being from Him, as the Father of it; ſo 'tis
Natural to Him to derive his virtues into them without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion,
as for a Vine to ſend up its ſap into its own
branches, or the Sun to cheriſh the plants of its own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction.
<hi>All</hi> the natural affections that are in Creatures
towards their own, are but <hi>drops</hi> of His <hi>Immenſe fullneſs:</hi>
A Mother may poſſibly forget the Child of her Womb;
but, the Lord cannot forget His Off-ſpring: <hi>That none may
hurt, them,</hi> (nor they themſelves) <hi>He will keep them night
and day,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſaiah 27. 3. chap. 46. 3, 4.</note> 
                  <hi>and water them every moment. They are born by
Him from the Belly, and carried from the Womb; and even
to their old age He will carry them and deliver them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. The new Creature, as it <hi>comes from God;</hi> ſo, it <hi>exiſts
in Him,</hi> and <hi>lives upon Him;</hi> and it is <hi>Natural</hi> to it, to
ſeek its nouriſhment where it had its Original: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can ſatisfie it, but that great Deep from whence it
ſprang; As a New-born child (that has not the uſe of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon)
will hunt for the breaſt by natural inſtinct, and not
be qulet without it: As ſoon as ever <hi>Paul</hi> was conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<hi>Behold he prayes, Acts</hi> 9. 11. Having once received the
Spirit of Chriſt, they cannot but incline after Him, (as
<hi>Eliſha</hi> did <hi>Elijah</hi> upon the caſting of his Mantle on him:)
It is natural to them,<note place="margin">1 K. 19. 19, 20.</note> as for ſparks to fly upwards: They
are ſaid To be <hi>baptized with fire;</hi> Not onely, becauſe of the
<hi>purifying</hi> Nature of fire; but in reſpect of its <hi>Aſpiring</hi> qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
it will be Mounting, and not reſt till it come to its own
<hi>element.</hi> Obſtructions many it meets withall, but ſtill it
preſſeth onwards, and by degrees bears-down all afore it,
and carries <hi>that</hi> with it in which it dwells, to the place of
its birth; As the Dove could not Reſt, till ſhe came to the
Ark, whence ſhe ſet-out? This is lively ſet forth by our
Saviour in <hi>John</hi> 7. 38. <hi>He that believeth in Me, out of his belly
ſhall flow Rivers of living Waters:</hi> [Rivers] that bear down

Then, in the Genuine uſe and property of them.</p>
               <p>1. As they are a Gift; They are of thoſe, <hi>good and perfect
Gifts which come down from above, from the Father of lights,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:60927:116"/>
with whom is no Variableneſs,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">James 1. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>nor ſhaddow of Turning.</hi> This
Attribute of God's <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nchangeableneſs,</hi> is fitly and ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantly
added, to ſhew, That as good and perfect gifts only,
are from God, and from Him onely; ſo, That He never
Changeth in His Purpoſe concerning thoſe to whom He
once gives them: They are of thoſe Gifts that are <hi>without
Repentance.</hi> As alſo, That theſe His Gifts do partake of
His own <hi>unvariableneſs;</hi> They cannot dye, nor turn to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other than what they are at firſt, ſave only in point of
Perfection: There can happen no after-unworthineſs in
thoſe He gives them to, which He did not foreſee when He
gave them; (which ſeems to be implied in the following
words,<note place="margin">v. 18.</note> [<hi>Of His Own Will begate He us:</hi>] and ſo, no cauſe
why He ſhould with-draw them, which ſhould not aſwell
have hindred His giving them at <hi>firſt.</hi> As the <hi>word</hi> of God
is not <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Nay;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 19.</note> ſo neither are His Gifts. They are
alſo God's <hi>Workmanſhip;</hi> And we <hi>know,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon)
That whatſoever God doth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 3, 14.</note> 
                  <hi>it ſhall be for ever; Nothing can
be added to it, Nor anything taken from it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Let <hi>Faith and Holineſs</hi> be conſidered in the Genuine
uſe and Property of them. Nothing ſo endangers the Soul,
as ſelf-fullneſs; <hi>Faith</hi> (therefore) was ordained to empty out
ſelf, and devolve the ſoul on Another, (<hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt) which
the more it does, the ſafer it is; And having once done it, it
never undoes it agen. <hi>Faith</hi> (alſo) is an Active Grace, and
diligent;<note place="margin">Luke 19. 26. Math. 13. 10.</note> and therefore thriving: He that hath it, ſhall have
<hi>more</hi> of it; (Then ſure he ſhall not loſe that he hath:)
It is alwayes Travelling, and never tyred; 1. Becauſe it
travels in the ſtrength of <hi>Omnipotency:</hi> and 2. Becauſe it
works by <hi>love;</hi> Which is the moſt kindly and efficacious
Principle of ſervice and great Acts. Love is an Endleſs
skrew; It has truly attain'd the perpetual Motion; It <hi>ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
to endure all things and faileth not,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 13. 7, 8. All
that God doth for His people is from love, <hi>John</hi> 3. 16. and
all that they do for God, growes from the ſame Root; They
<hi>love Him,</hi> [becauſe] <hi>He loved them, firſt;</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 19.
Love is That which renders a Work both pleaſant to the
Agent, and acceptable to the Object of it. Faith (therefore)
working by love, ſhall never be weary of its work, nor fail
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:60927:116"/>
of its end;<note place="margin">Rom. 4. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>It is of Faith, That it might be ſure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as for <hi>Holineſs,</hi> (which is a diſpoſition according to
God, and capacitates for the bleſſed Viſion) a little of it in
Truth,<note place="margin">Math. 12. 20.</note> is of infinite worth; The very ſmoak of it ſhall not
be quenched: And it would be ſtrange, if a thing ſo <hi>precious</hi>
ſhould be lyable to <hi>putrifaction:</hi> But it is not; yea, it chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
other things, but is it ſelf never changed: It is of a
ſpreading nature; compared therefore to leaven, which is
put into the Soul and hid there, till the <hi>whole lump</hi> be ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
It is of an <hi>aſſimilating</hi> property; there is an Heavenly
<hi>Tincture</hi> in it, which ſanctifies all that it toucheth; <hi>To the
pure all things are pure.</hi> It alſo meetens for Converſe with
<hi>God;</hi> and it drawes and ingageth the Soul to <hi>Him; There</hi>
it is as in its proper <hi>Element,</hi> and out of which it cannot live:
And, by this Converſe it is both increaſed and ſublimated.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Natural</hi> Body once in <hi>being,</hi> can never be reduced to
<hi>Nothing:</hi> How then ſhould Things of <hi>Divine</hi> ſubſtance?
They are <hi>Born of incorruptible ſeed, which liveth and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
for ever:</hi> And as the ſeed is, ſuch will be the fruit;
The Older it grows, the firmer it is; <hi>He that hath clean
hands ſhall be ſtronger and ſtronger:</hi> They are the <hi>Holy
Seed,</hi> And therefore, tho they caſt their leaves (at times)
yet <hi>their ſubſtance is in them,</hi> By which they are ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed.</p>
               <p>To all which might be added, that Notion alſo in <hi>Romans</hi>
8. 30. which inferreth, That to be <hi>ſanctified,</hi> is all one as to
be <hi>glorified:</hi> Holineſs is the ſeed of Glory; and holy perſons
are in Glory; (<hi>viz.</hi> as to its kind, and the certainty of their
obtainment;) although (indeed) it hath no glory at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
in compariſon of that which ſhall be; as the ſeed of a
Roſe or Lilly, compared with the flowers they will grow
into; and which are virtually in them. According with
this, is that of our Saviour,<note place="margin">John 3. 36. Pſ. 37. 31.</note> 
                  <hi>He that believeth [hath] ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
life:</hi> It argues the certainty of their Perſeverance;
<hi>The law of his God is in his heart: None of his ſteps ſhall
ſlide:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 65. 8.</note> And therefore he ſaith, <hi>Deſtroy it Not, there is a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
in it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>III. Another proof riſes from the <hi>Nature,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> III.</note> 
                  <hi>extent, and
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:60927:117"/>
deſign, of Providence;</hi> or from the Intent and Purpoſe of
God, in that great variety of things which believers are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed
with in the world. There are three things conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
to make out this Argument;</p>
               <p>1. <hi>That there is a Divine Providence which Governs the
World:</hi> As in dividing to the Nations their inheritance, and
bounding their habitations, at firſt; ſo, by continuing
them in poſſeſſion, or Outing them, at his pleaſure; and
this (oftentimes) by very unlikely means, and over-ruling
things accordingly: <hi>Seir</hi> being given to <hi>Eſau,</hi> and <hi>Ar</hi> to
the Children of Lot; and their term not being yet expired;
the Lord inclines them to let Iſrael paſs thorow, and to
give them meat for their money: whereas the <hi>Amorites,</hi>
who were deſtinied to deſtruction, <hi>He hardens their ſpirits
and makes them obſtinate;</hi> that they deny them paſſage,
and come out againſt them in battel.<note place="margin">Deut. 2. 29, 30.</note> So, when he would
tranſlate the Chaldean Monarchy to the Perſians; He <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feebles</hi>
the one,<note place="margin">Jer. 51. 11.</note>
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 45. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>5.</note> but <hi>ſtirrs up</hi> the Others ſpirits, and <hi>Girds
them with ſtrength.</hi> How oft doth the Scripture repeat,
<hi>That the Lord reigneth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſ. 93. 1. 97. 1. 75. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>That He puts down One and ſets
up another, That He doth according to His Will in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of Heaven, and among the Inhabitants of the earth?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dan. 4, 35.</note>
How evident is it in his humbling of <hi>Pharaoh, Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar,</hi>
and others! This Providence reacheth to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Perſons, times, and things; and Circumſcribes
them: It leaves not the leaſt thing to a Contingency; Even
Ravens, Sparrows, and Lillies, yea, and the hairs of your
head are all numbred and under the Conduct of the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 26.</p>
               <p>2. That <hi>the deſign and courſe of God's Providence,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eezk. 24. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>is to
accompliſh His Purpoſe.</hi> As <hi>Providence</hi> governs the World;
ſo <hi>Purpoſe</hi> is the <hi>Director</hi> of Providence. He is a Provident
Man that orders his affairs prudently: <hi>i. e.</hi> ſo that nothing
is wanting, nor any thing ſpent in waſte. Both theſe are
in the Providence of God eminently: for 1. It is All-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient;
ſupplies all needs; Gives all things pertaining to
Means and End: 2. It does Nothing in vain, Nothing ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous
or impertinent to His Purpoſe. Things moſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:60927:117"/>
to Men, are levelled at a ſet and Certain End: <hi>What
the Lord ſpeaks with His Mouth, He fullfills with His
Hand,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. 24. and His Act ſhall not vary a tittle
from His Decree, which is clearly the meaning of that in
the <hi>Acts, Known unto God are all His Works from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the world.</hi> Whence was it, that <hi>Eſau</hi> tarried ſo
long at his hunting, that he was overfainted? That <hi>Jacob</hi>
was making pottage juſt when <hi>Eſau</hi> comes home, which
ſet his appetite on edge after it? But, <hi>that the Purpoſe
of God according to Election might ſtand:</hi> The Elder muſt
ſerve the younger; which now came-to-paſs by the ſale of
his birthright. And thus the Providence of God makes
even the prophaneſs of Men, ſubſerve to His End. The
Lord had determined to caſt <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> out of
His ſight, for their obſtinacy: And to this end (that is, To
make way for it) <hi>it came-to-paſs,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 King 24. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>that</hi> Zedekiah <hi>rebelled
againſt the King of Babylon:</hi> It was to fullfill the word of
the Lord declared in the 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36. 21. (tho <hi>that</hi> was
farr from the Rebellers intent.) So He gave <hi>Cyrus</hi> all the
Kingdoms of the Earth, that he might build His Temple
at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and it was to fullfill His Purpoſe before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
by <hi>Jeremy</hi> the Prophet; as <hi>ver.</hi> 22. &amp; 23. In like
manner, <hi>Herod, Pilate,</hi> and the <hi>Jews,</hi> they all conſpire the
death of Chriſt, and each party on a ſeveral account; not
thinking (in the leaſt,) to fulfil the determinate Counſell of
God; yet, <hi>That</hi> was it, which <hi>Providence</hi> intended, in
permitting the Thing to be done; as is plain, by <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 23.
As alſo, the Soldiers, in parting His garments and piercing
His ſide; It was their barbarous rudeneſs which put them
upon it; But, <hi>Providence</hi> deſigned to make-good a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy,
<hi>Theſe things [therefore] the Soldiers did, John,</hi> 19.
24. All that God doth in the World, is the Tranſcript, or
Impreſſion, of His Decrees.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>That the Providence of God never fails of Its End:
Our God is in Heaven, and doth whatſoever He will.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſ. 115. 3.</note> He will
Work, and who ſhall let it? And what will He work? <hi>The
things that are coming and ſhall come:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 44. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>He hath both deviſed
and done it, Jer.</hi> 51. 12. His Purpoſe is, To preſerve His
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:60927:118"/>
People,<note place="margin">Iſa. 54. 17.</note> and therefore, <hi>No Weapon that is formed againſt them
ſhall proſper: Whoſoever gathers together againſt them ſhall
fall for their ſake, Iſa.</hi> 54. 15. And, <hi>As He hath purpoſed, ſo
ſhall it ſtand; Chap.</hi> 14. 24. The Scriptures abound with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
to prove it. As on the Contrary, When the Lord
will execute Judgment, it ſhall be performed, albeit the
Means be never ſo weak and improbable; <hi>Tho' the Army
of the Chaldeans were all wounded men, yet ſhall they burn Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem
with fire,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Judges 3. 31. ch. 15. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Jer.</hi> 37. 10. <hi>SHAMGAR</hi> ſhall kill ſix
hundred Men with an Ox-goad; and <hi>SAMPSON,</hi> a
Thouſand with the Jaw-bone of an Aſs. Theſe things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
and laid together, (though chiefly referring to Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
things) doe ſtrongly inforce the Argument, for things
of ſpiritual Concernment: Inaſmuch as things of Eternal
Moment are worthy of more peculiar regard and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity.</p>
               <p>Now, All a Believer's exerciſes (which may ſeem to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger
him) are either from the guilt of ſins committed;
From the power of indwelling corruption; From Satan's
temptations; or Perſecution from the World: None of
which come on them <hi>accidentally,</hi> but as things <hi>fore-ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed</hi>
of God, and for a good intent. It is <hi>for the Elects
ſake that all things elſe have their being,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 15. <hi>And
are all cauſed to work together for their good, Rom.</hi> 8. 28. As
(namely) to humble them for ſin; To wean them from the
World; To indear <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST</hi> to them; To ſhew
them the uſefulneſs of Ordinances; To exerciſe and try
their Graces; To purge out their droſs; To enable them
to ſuccour others; To demonſtrate the Wiſdom, Power,
and Faithfulneſs of God towards them; To meeten them
for Heaven; And to make them groan and long to be
clothed upon with their houſe from thence; As might plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully
be made out by the Scriptures, and the viſible effects
thereof upon thoſe who have been exerciſed thereby. To
inſtance a few particulars: <hi>David,</hi> after that great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage
in the matter of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> with his broken bones
upon it; walked the more humbly and warily all his
dayes: He was alſo the more intent on that great duty of
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:60927:118"/>
                  <hi>Teaching ſinners the way of God.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 51. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Peter,</hi> he alſo got ground
by denying his Maſter; Thereby he came to ſee his own
weakneſs, the need he had of Chriſt's ſupport, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
prayer for him; and we hear no more of his carnal
confidence, after that: But, What a clamour and out-cry
does he make againſt our adverſary the Devil!<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 8.</note> to warn
others (by his own example) what danger they are in:
And doubtleſs, what the Tempter got by <hi>Peter's</hi> fall, he
loſt the double of it by the after-watchfulneſs of Others;
For that's the deſigned end,<note place="margin">Luke 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>viz.</hi> To <hi>ſtrengthen, ſtabliſh,
ſettle them, ver.</hi> 10. <hi>Paul</hi> had a Meſſenger of Satan let
looſs upon him, to buffet him: The end of which was to
humble him, and To ſhew him the ſufficiency of the Grace
of Chriſt. 'Tis likely alſo, That he got as much by that
<hi>thorn</hi> in his fleſh, as by his <hi>Rapture and Revelations:</hi> To be
ſure, they did well together, and poized him the better
for his work.<note place="margin">Job. 23. 10 with ch. 40. 4. &amp; ch. 42. 6.</note> The like effect upon <hi>Job. Mary Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi>

it heighten her love to Chriſt, and keep her heart in a mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
frame! <hi>She loved much, becauſe much was forgiven her.</hi>
The People's fourty years travel thro' that great and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
wilderneſs,<note place="margin">Deut. 8. 15, 16.</note> among fiery Serpents and ſcorpions; It
was To <hi>prove</hi> them, and to <hi>doe them good</hi> in the latter end:
They were alſo ſent into captivity <hi>for their good:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 24. 5.</note>
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 27. 9.</note> This was
<hi>all the fruit</hi> intended, <hi>To take away their ſin;</hi> and <hi>to make

               </p>

deſires not: Yet let me ſay, They are as needfull in
their ſeaſon as our food; and in very Faithfullneſs we muſt
have them: which alſo appears by the ſcope of the new
Covenant; (Of which more afterwards.)</p>
               <p>Upon all which, It is ſafely inferred, That <hi>all theſe things
worketh God with Man;</hi> Not to deſtroy him, but <hi>To
bring-back his ſoul from the pit, Job</hi> 33. 29. &amp; 30. They are

And if this be the fruit and Reſult of all that doth or can
befall a Believer, whiles in this World: (and ther's no more
of evil or danger when this is done) then welcom let them
be, as another Demonſtration of their <hi>INVINCIBLE
PERSEVERANCE.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>IV. A fourth Argument for the Saints Perſeverance,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> IV.</note> is
built on their Union with Chriſt; Which is of that Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mateneſs,
that the Scripture ſets it forth by terms of near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Relation; as Foundation and Building, Vine and
Branches, Father and Children, Husband and Spouſe,
Head and Members; Yea, They are <hi>both</hi> called (inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably)
by the <hi>ſame</hi> Name; He is called <hi>Jacob, Pſal.</hi>
24. 6. And they are called <hi>Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 12. And
(which is more, if more can be) He communicates to them
<hi>that</hi> title which one would think Incommunicable, <hi>viz. The
Lord our Righteouſneſs, Jer.</hi> 23. 6. with chap. 33. 16.
And this Union is ſuch as can never be broken; It is no
more poſſible, than for the Union which is between God
and Chriſt to be diſſolv'd: For, the ſame Oneneſs (for kinde)
is between Chriſt and them, as between the Father and
Chriſt; which is plain by that paſſage of His prayer in
the 17 <hi>John, ver.</hi> 21. <hi>That they all may be One</hi> (How one?)
<hi>as thou Father art in Me and I in Thee, That they may be
One in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s.</hi> They are ſo near to Him, that they are ſaid
to be <hi>Of His fleſh and of His bones, Eph.</hi> 5. 30. as alſo,
That they are <hi>one Spirit, i. e.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 17.</note> He and They are Actuated by
the ſame Spirit, as the head and members of the ſame Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
are by One Soul. And this is the true reaſon why Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
cannot walk after the fleſh, becauſe <hi>The Spirit of
life which is in Chriſt Ieſus</hi> (as their root) <hi>rules in them,
Rom.</hi> 8. 2.<note place="margin">Jude ver. 2.</note> They are <hi>preſerved</hi> in Chriſt as <hi>Noah</hi> was in the
Ark; or as branches in their own ſtock: For, this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
is ſtill to be Noted, That Believers have not this
life in themſelves, as Chriſt hath; but they have it in him,
which is <hi>better</hi> for them than if in their own keeping: For,
being in Him as in a Root, It is natural to Him to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:60927:119"/>
and as natural to them (by virtue of the Divine Nature
communicated to them) to Derive from Him: And ſo,
<hi>Becauſe</hi> (and whiles) <hi>He lives,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 14. 19. 1</note>
                  <note place="margin">Joh 5. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>They ſhall live alſo: He that
hath the Son, hath life:</hi> and they have it in a way of <hi>Right;</hi>
as he that is poſſeſt of the ſoil, has right to all that grows

               <p>1. <hi>Power:</hi> In <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. 27, God's Sovereign Power over
all fleſh is laid-down as the ground of their faith, touching
their Return from Captivity, and His giving them a new

                  <note place="margin">Jer. 32. 7. with ver. 36 to 41.</note> as they had done. So, when

but, as preponderating What they are to doe, and
what is requiſite for their doing of it; and ſo, apportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
their ſtrength and aſſiſtance anſwerably: As at making
the World, <hi>He weighed the Mountains in ſcales, and the
hills in a ballance;</hi> that its parts might be of equal weight:
Or, as one that's to Run in a Race, and muſt carry Weights
about him; it will be his wiſdom to have them evenly
poiz'd: So, the Lord ſets one thing againſt another, in our
ſouls Concernments. In <hi>Rom.</hi> 16, <hi>Paul</hi> brings-in this
Wiſdom of God,<note place="margin">Rom. 16. 25. 27</note> (as well as His Power) to help their
Faith, touching their eſtabliſhment: and the Apoſtle <hi>Jude,</hi> in

                  <hi>and preſenting them faultleſs before the preſence of His
Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. <hi>Honour:</hi> The concernment of God's <hi>honour,</hi> is alſo
an important Argument for proof of this Doctrine: The
Lord's manner of dealing with His People of old, and the
Reaſon of it, is an Inſtance above Contradiction. The
Promiſe of giving them <hi>Canaan,</hi> was not more Abſolute
than the Promiſe of Salvation to Believers; Nor was it
leſs clog'd with Conditions, Threatnings, and Cautions,
(which were afterwards added:) But, the promiſe being
once made <hi>abſolute,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 15. 18.</note> [<hi>To thy ſeed will I give this land</hi>] the
Lord held Himſelf obliged in honour,<note place="margin">Chap. 12. 7.</note> to make it good.
How often did He ſeem to be pouring out His wrath to
deſtroy them? Firſt in <hi>Egypt,</hi> Then in the Wilderneſs: (as
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:60927:121"/>
appears by <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20. 8, 13, 21, 22, and 40 verſes.) And
what was it that kept it off? It was the Intereſt of God's
<hi>Honour;</hi> This put Him upon finding out Wayes to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
them;<note place="margin">Ezek. 20. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>I wrought</hi> (ſayes He) <hi>for my Name's ſake:</hi> The
Lord did (as it were) labour and work to ſuppreſs His
righteous fury, incenſed by their intolerable provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
His Name and honour were concern'd, and that held
His hands; He had once made an <hi>abſolute</hi> Promiſe, which
therefore <hi>muſt</hi> be made-good, tho' they made themſelves
never ſo unworthy of it.</p>
               <p>The like ye have in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 48, They had dealt very
treacherouſly, (than which, Nothing is more provoking:)
But, (ſayes the Lord) <hi>For my Names ſake will I deferr mine
anger, v.</hi> 9. And Agen, <hi>v.</hi> 11. <hi>For mine Own ſake, even for mine
Own ſake, will I do it; For, how ſhould My Name be pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?</hi>
The Lord will over-look a Thouſand tranſgreſſions,
rather than expoſe His Name and honour to Reproach,
as once it was by a temporary ſuſpenſion: To Recover
which, and that His Name might be ſanctified, He will
bring them home agen; yea, tho' it be in the eyes of Men,
a Thing <hi>impoſſible;</hi> and they themſelves doe think ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe;
For, <hi>Our hope is loſt, and we are cut off,</hi> (ſay they)
<hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. 11. and <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 18. <hi>My hope is periſhed from the
Lord.</hi> Whether at home, or abroad, they ſtill cauſed His
Name to be prophaned: And for this His Holy Name, He had
pitty on them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 20, 21. For, if He ſhould have
caſt them off for ever, It would have been ſaid, Either
That He did not foreſee how unworthy a people they
would be; Or, He was not able to keep them in their own
Land; Or to bring them back agen: Or els, That He was
Changeable in His Purpoſes, and not true to His word, &amp;c.
ſome reflexion or other they would caſt upon Him, which
He could not bear. All which, &amp; much more of like kinde, is
applicable to Belivers, with reſpect to their Perſeverance.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Juſtice,</hi> or <hi>Righteouſneſs;</hi> There can hardly be found
a firmer ſupport, or more plenary conſolation to Believers,
than That the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of God is engaged to ſave them; For,
<hi>The Righteous Lord will doe no iniquity.</hi> He would not
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:60927:122"/>
Juſtify (No, Not) His very Elect, but in a way conſiſtent
with His Righteouſneſs: For which cauſe, He ſet-forth
Chriſt a Propitiation for ſin. Surely then, having received
the Attonement, He will not expoſe His Juſtice to cenſure,
by leaving them, in any wiſe obnoxious to comdemnation.

<hi>endureth for ever.</hi> The great Covenant is <hi>Founded</hi> in
Mercy, and is therefore ſtyled <hi>The ſure Mercies of David,
Iſa.</hi> 55. I ſhall not add, touching this Attribute; For, if all
the <hi>Reſt</hi> be on our ſide, (and you ſee They are) the <hi>Mercy</hi>

hath enliſted and brought-in all the Reſt.</p>
               <p>VI. The Saints Perſeverance may alſo be Argued from
the <hi>Ends</hi> of their being,<note place="margin">Arg. VI.</note> with the <hi>Author</hi> or thoſe Ends:
(This, the Scripture puts weight upon.) Their <hi>Ends</hi> are,
To glorifie God, and to be glorified with Him: But, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of theſe can be attained without Perſevering: Not
the firſt, For, nothing ſo diſhonours God, as Apoſtacy:
Not the latter, becauſe ſuch onely as endure to the End,
ſhall be ſaved. They muſt (therefore) Perſevere, Or thoſe
Ends will be fruſtrate; which will not ſtand with the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's
authority.</p>
               <p>That <hi>theſe</hi> were the ends of their Being, is evident, <hi>Iſa.</hi>
43. 21, <hi>This People have I formed for my ſelf;</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>I cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
him for my Glory.</hi> The Apoſtle alſo is very expreſs
for it, in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. where, ſpeaking of that Divine build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Heavens, prepared for Believers; he tells us,
<hi>They were wrought for that ſelf ſame thing.</hi> The manner of
expreſſion is much to be remark'd: It is not barely ſaid,
This End, or this thing, we were made for: but (in effect)
This very thing, and nothing els, (to be ſure nothing leſs)
was the very ſcope and end of our Creation, both old and
new, even of all God's workmanſhip upon us. And, as
evident it is, That God Himſelf is the <hi>Authour</hi> of thoſe
Ends, and that <hi>therefore</hi> they cannot miſcarry. Upon this
ground the Lord would have his People to found an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dauntable</hi>
confidence, (as well may be gather'd from His
ſo frequent indigitating of it.) In <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43. He thus forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
them againſt the ſoreſt of evils; <hi>Fear not,</hi> for [<hi>I] have

[I, even I the Lord] ver.</hi> 11. and Chap. 41. 10. <hi>Fear thou
not, for [I] am with thee: [I] will ſtrengthen thee, [I] will
help thee, yea [I] will uphold thee:</hi> The emphaſis lies in the
perſon <hi>active. [I] i. e.</hi> I the Lord, (a note of infinite ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
and ſecurity to Believers!) The Apoſtle alſo, in
that 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. That Believers might know themſelves <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincibly</hi>
ſecur'd, he points us to God, as the Great Author
of thoſe important Ends, and Almighty Undertaker for their
accompliſhment; <hi>He that wrought us for the ſelf ſame thing,
is [God</hi>] It is as if he had ſaid, It is impoſſible we ſhould
loſe the thing we were wrought for, becauſe, it is God that
wrought us for it: It is not the deſignment of an Idol; that
is, Of ſome <hi>Ignorant, Raſh, Fallible,</hi> or <hi>Mutable</hi> Agent;
ſuch a One as may poſſibly be <hi>ſurpriſed</hi> by unlook'd-for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents;
<hi>Circumvented</hi> by a ſublimer underſtanding;
<hi>Over-born</hi> by a power above him; or <hi>Recede</hi> from his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
thro' levity and fickleneſs of his nature; &amp;c. But it
is [<hi>God</hi>] who is <hi>wiſe in Heart and Mighty in ſtrength, Job</hi>
9. 4. It is He from whom all things that are, have their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and are perfectly under His Rule and obeiſance: He
had Eternity afore Him, to lay His Deſign <hi>ſurely;</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
<hi>He declareth the End from the beginning, and
changeth not.</hi> It is therefore as impoſſible for Him either
to <hi>Doe,</hi> or <hi>neglect</hi> to doe, or <hi>ſuffer</hi> to be done, any thing
whereby His purpoſe might ſuffer diſappointment; as it
is impoſſible <hi>That God ſhould lye.</hi> He would never have
ſet-up thoſe Ends as the Sum and Upſhot of His great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
if He had not Determined to ſee them made-good.
And therefore (as ſayes the Apoſtle) <hi>We are alwaies confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
That when abſent from the Body, we ſhall be preſent
with the Lord, ver.</hi> 6 <hi>&amp;</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>This is alſo further confirm'd by that compendious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
<hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 33. <hi>I will be their God, and they ſhall be my
People:</hi> Every word (here) hath a peculiar emphaſis;
1. That He will be a [<hi>God</hi>] to them: 2. [<hi>Their</hi>] God:
and 3. [<hi>for ever</hi>]: This [<hi>I will</hi>] imports both a <hi>fix'd Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,</hi>
                  <pb n="239" facs="tcp:60927:124"/>
&amp; <hi>Time without limit.</hi> It is as if He had ſaid, Though
other lords <hi>have had</hi> the Rule over you, and you have <hi>ſtill</hi>
a Proneneſs to Revolt to them; It ſhall not be: I will not be
Outed any more; I'l heal your backſlidings, and be your
God ſtill: I'l carry it towards you and for you, as becomes
a <hi>God</hi> to doe: and I will make you <hi>ſuch a People,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh
God to own; <hi>I will not be aſhamed to be called
your God, Heb.</hi> 11. 16. It would (indeed) be both a diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
and diſſatisfaction to God, if His People ſhould
fail of that He made them for; which (certainly) cannot
be, becauſe God is theirs; and if God be theirs, all things
are theirs, both this World and that to come; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.

               <p>Laſtly,<note place="margin">Arg. VII.</note> For the final Perſeverance of Believers, a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Argument is fetch'd from the <hi>Sovereign Decree of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection.</hi>
I call it <hi>Sovereign,</hi> partly Becauſe it is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Manifeſtation of God's abſolute Dominion over His
Creatures, in Chooſing whom He would, and paſſing-by
the Reſt: Partly alſo, becauſe all ſorts of things what ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
are ſubjected to it, and made ſubſervient to its final
accompli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hment. And this I take, for a principal Reaſon
why Election is ſo frequently placed in Eternity, (or, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>
the Foundation of the World) <hi>viz,</hi> To ſhew, That the
very Fabrick of the World, and all Occurrences therein,
were ſo contrived and framed in God's Decree, as having
Election for their primary ſcope and End: That this <hi>firſt</hi>
Cauſe is the <hi>Supream</hi> Moderator of <hi>all intermediate</hi> Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and is it ſelf ſubject to <hi>None.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was not any lovelineſs in Elect perſons, which moved
God to love them at firſt; ſo neither ſhall their unlovely
backſlidings deprive them of it, (though it may be eclips'd,
by their own default, to the breaking of their bones.) The
Lord Choſe them for that bleſſed Image of His Own which
He would afterwards imprint upon them, and <hi>this</hi> He ſtill
proſecutes through all diſpenſations.</p>
               <p>That Elect Nation the <hi>Jews,</hi> They apoſtatized from
God, and did worſe than any Other; yet, the Lord would
not utterly caſt them off. In <hi>Samuel's</hi> time their wickedneſs
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:60927:125"/>
was very great; yet, ſaith he, (to ſtay them from <hi>total</hi>
apoſtacy;) <hi>The Lord will not forſake you:</hi> But, what is the
ground of that his great confidence, and grand Warranty?
The very ſame that now we are upon; <hi>The Lord will not
forſake you, becauſe, [It hath pleaſed the Lord to make you
His People:</hi>] Not becauſe they remembred their duty and
returned to God; but becauſe <hi>He remembred for them
His Covenant:</hi> In purſuance whereof, He long maintained
their title, Notwithſtanding their often-repeated forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
and when in Captivity, brought them home again.
And indeed,<note place="margin">Ezek. 16. 62, 63.</note> Nothing ſo melts the hearts of Thoſe in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
with God, as the <hi>the Lord ſhould be pacified towards
them after all their abominations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The manner of God's dealings with this people, is
eſpecially Inſtructive, to help the faith of the ſpiritual
Election, upon all occaſions; as holding-forth the ſpecial
Regard the Lord hath for them, becauſe of His <hi>Covenant:</hi>
That tho' He may, and will, puniſh their iniquities, yet
His loving kindnefs He will not take from them.<note place="margin">Ezek. 36. 11.</note> And He
puts it ſtill upon His having once Choſen them, as you
have it in <hi>Jeremy, ch.</hi> 41. 9, <hi>I have choſen thee, and not
caſt thee away.</hi> This later Clauſe, [<hi>And not caſt thee away</hi>]
ſeems added to ſhew, That His <hi>Chooſing</hi> them was an Act
<hi>unrepealable: q. d.</hi> I knew aforehand What thou wouldſt
Doe, and how thou wouldſt prove: and, if I had meant
<hi>Ever</hi> to Caſt thee off; yea, if I had not Reſolved againſt
it; I would not have Choſen thee at all; But, ſince I have,
Be ſure I'l ſtand by thee, <hi>I will ſtrengthen thee, I will help
thee, I will uphold thee with the Right hand of my righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>

               <p>It is true, The body of that Nation, for their unbelief,
are now broken off: (There is a ſuſpenfion of the outward

are acted <hi>Now</hi> by another principle: (as a horſe that is

is not (henceforth) the <hi>fear</hi> of wrath, but the ſenſe of
Chriſt's love in <hi>delivering</hi> from wrath, that both Curbs the

               <p>In like manner, <hi>Samuel;</hi> when the People were greatly

to Perſeverance.</p>
               <p>Scriptures to this purpoſe might be multiplied: But
theſe (I hope) may have left the Objection without footing.
But, beſides our Scripture-proof, It is evident in Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
That nothing ſo Elevates the Spirit and Courage of
a Man in great undertakings, as <hi>aſſurance of Succeſs:</hi> But,
whiles he is wavering, and doubtfull How he ſhall ſpeed,
eſpecially whiles he meditates <hi>Terrours,</hi> and of them the
<hi>Dreadfulleſt;</hi> his hands are enfeebled, Nor he has not his
Wits about him: That which tends (in truth) to make a
Man <hi>Steadfaſt, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nmoveable,</hi> and <hi>alwaies to abound in the
work of the Lord;</hi> is not the fear of Miſcarrying, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing

               <head>If a Man once believing cannot loſe his faith, Why is it
ſaid, Let him that ſtandeth, take heed leſt he fall? and
Look to your ſelves, that we loſe not the things we have

and ſo great Circumſpection?</head>
               <p>The Maker of this Objection hath elſwhere granted, that
the poſſeſſion of <hi>Canaan</hi> was ſure to <hi>Abraham's</hi> ſeed, ſo as
all their unworthineſs could not deprive them of it: And
yet we find, their Induction and actual Poſſeſſion, yoked
(afterwards) with as many Conditions, Cautions, and limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations;
as the Promiſe of Salvation to Believers, any where
is; and yet, Nevertheleſs Certain. But, for more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
anſwer,</p>
               <p>1. It is evident, That a Righteous Man <hi>may fall;</hi> and
as evident it is, That he <hi>cannot fall finally:</hi> For, tho'
he falls <hi>Seaven times</hi> in a day, <hi>as often</hi> does he Riſe

him with His hand,</hi> Pſal. 37. 24. And Pſal. 145. <hi>The Lord
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:60927:130"/>
upholdeth all that fall:</hi> Either He ſtayes them when they
are falling; Or, He ſo Orders and limits the matter, that they
fall not into miſchief,<note place="margin">Hoſ. 14. 4.</note> as others do: And, to be ſure, He'l ſet
them on their feet agen. The Abſolute Promiſe cannot be
Null'd or diſcertain'd by Cautionary words elſewhere deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered:<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 17.</note>
It cannot therfore by meant of a Total and Final
falling away, which the Scripture-Current expreſly Runs
againſt.</p>
               <p>2. There are Conſiderations enough and of great weight,
Why Believers ſhould take heed of Falling, without ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
a Total loſs of their Faith; (The breaking of a Man's
<hi>bones,</hi> is ground ſufficient for ſuch a Caution, altho' he be
ſure that his <hi>Neck</hi> ſhall be ſafe:) The diſhonour done to
his Father; The ſhame that is put upon Chriſt; Grieving
the Comforter; Scandalizing the good ways of God; ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
the Weak; Strengthening the Wicked; The unfitting
of him for his duty; Interrupting his Peace and Communion
with God; &amp;c. Every of which will weigh deep, with a ſoul
that is born of God.</p>
               <p>3. The Lord brings-about His Purpoſes (for moſt part)
by Means; Of which, Cautions are a part; and by which
(as a Means) He keeps-off the evill Caution'd-againſt. In
the 1 <hi>John.</hi> 2. 28. the Apoſtle exhorts them to <hi>abide in Chriſt:</hi>
(whom certain Profeſſors had relinquiſhed, <hi>v.</hi> 19.) And, as
purpoſely intending to obviate this objection, he tells them,
<hi>That they ſhall abide in him,</hi> v. 27. Whereby he ſtrengthens
them to their duty.</p>
               <p>For the other place objected, (<hi>viz. Look to your ſelves that
we loſe not the things we have wrought;</hi>) It is one thing to
loſe (for a time) the <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Comfort</hi> of Our ſtate; as
<hi>David, Heman,</hi> and Others, did; and another thing to loſe
the ſtate it ſelf; which a Believer ſhall never do, as is ſhewn
afore. Of much like Import is that in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
verſes, where he exhorts them, To <hi>give all diligence, to add
one Grace to another:</hi> And, to help them in their work, he
tells them, 1. What advantages they ſhall have by their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing;
They <hi>ſhall not be unfruitfull in the knowledge of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt;</hi> i. e. It ſhall evidence to them that the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:60927:131"/>
ledge they have, is a <hi>real</hi> knowledge; which cannot be
known from that which is <hi>formal</hi> only, but by ſuch an effect.
That alſo by this Means it ſhall be increaſed; The uſing of
things well, and to their proper End, being the readieſt way
to their Improvement, according to <hi>john</hi> 7. 17. <hi>He that will
do my Will, ſhall know of my Doctrine.</hi> 2. He then ſets afore
them, the loſs they ſhall have, in caſe they neglect this great
Duty of <hi>Adding Grace to Grace: They will become blind;</hi>
that is, Unable to ſee afarr off; And forget, That <hi>they were
purged from their old ſins;</hi> that is, Their Remiſneſs in this
duty will bring <hi>obſcurity</hi> upon their Evidences; That which
was cleer to them <hi>afore,</hi> will <hi>Now</hi> become Clouded, and
be as if it were not; It may <hi>ſeem</hi> to them, That they
are ſhort of that Reſt,<note place="margin">Heb. 4. 1.</note> which yet is ſure to them; And ſo,
they'l be put to begin their work <hi>Anew:</hi> Whereas, <hi>if they
do theſe things, they ſhall never fall;</hi> i. e. They ſhall not fall
from their <hi>ſtedfaſtneſs,</hi> Nor loſe that cleer ſight and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
which now they have, touching their good eſtate, <hi>viz.</hi>
as being <hi>partakers of the Divine Nature,</hi> and <hi>Purged from

               <p>As for <hi>Simon Magus</hi> the Anſwer is as cleer concerning

               <p>1. That a Man may be ſaid to believe, and yet not be a
Believer; As a Right<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

a <hi>Sinner.</hi> To be a Believer, is to be thorow-paced in
faith; To believe all that is to be believed; and to have
the heart united to it: <hi>Thus Simon</hi> believed not; and if
he had, he could not have thought the Holy Ghoſt vendible
for Money.</p>
               <p>2. His faith ſeems to be onely ſuch a belief concerning
<hi>Philip,</hi> as the <hi>Samaritans</hi> ſometimes had concerning <hi>Simon;</hi>
viz.<note place="margin">Acts 8.</note> That he was <hi>the great power of God.</hi> For, finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
over-matcht by <hi>Philip,</hi> who caſt-out the Spirits which
he (perhaps) had poſſeſſed them with; he could not, now, but
give the precedency to <hi>Philip,</hi> as having a greater power
than himſelf: and therefore, <hi>he continued with</hi> Philip, <hi>wondring
at what he did;</hi> v. 13.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Simon's</hi> believing might be only an outward profeſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
faith, taken-up for by-reſpects; (which may well be
ſuppoſed) to preſerve his intereſt and repute among the
people, who now began to fall from him, and to follow
<hi>Philip;</hi> whoſe diſciple he himſelf will profeſs to be, rather
than be quite caſhier'd. Beſides, this profeſſion of his, might
(in his conceit) be a ſtep towards his <hi>purchaſing the gift of

agen in as good a Condition, for reputation and profit, as
before.</p>

               <head>This Doctrine of Abſolute Perſeverance, lays the Reigns of
Security on the Neck of the fleſh, and of the old man in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers?</head>
               <p>1. This Objection is (in effect) the ſame with the firſt;
Only it ſpeaks broader; which ſhews, That the farther Men
go in oppoſing the Truth, the worſe language they give it.
That <hi>Many</hi> who diſbelieve the Doctrine of Perſeverance,
have given the Fleſh its full Range and liberty,—Needs no
proof: But, That any Believer hath made that impious
improvement of it, will never be made-out.</p>
               <p>2. The Objection deſerves no Quarter; becauſe it highly
Reproaches the Goodneſs and Faithfulneſs of God; as if,
for a Fiſh, He had g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ven His People a Scorpion; For ſo it
would be, If His Giving them Abſolute Promiſes, ſhould
prove an Indulgence to the fleſh.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>It alſo Contradicts the known and conſtant way of holy
Men's Arguing and Inferring from Abſolute Promiſes, and
the higheſt Aſſurance: See a few Inſtances of this;</hi> Col. 3. 4,
When Chriſt our life ſhall appear, then ſhall ye alſo appear
with him in Glory: <hi>The Reſult of it is,</hi> Mortifie therefore your
Members which are upon the Earth. 1 Ioh. 3. 2; [We
know] That when He ſhall appear, We ſhall be like Him:
<hi>And what is the fruit of this knowledge?</hi> Every Man that
hath this hope in him, purifieth himſelf even as He is pure. <hi>The
like ye have in</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 1, For, we [know] that if our earthly
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:60927:134"/>
houſe of this tabernacle were diſſolved, we have a building of
God, an houſe not made with hands, Eternal in the Heavens:
<hi>and what the effect of this great Knowledg was, ye have in
the</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi> Wherefore We labour, That whether preſent or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
we may be accepted of Him. <hi>In</hi> 2 Cor. 6. 18. <hi>is repeated
the Sum of the New Covenant; I</hi> will be a Father unto you,
and ye ſhall be my Sons and Daughters, ſaith the Lord Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty:
<hi>See now the uſe he makes of it; (And all Believers
have the ſame Mind:</hi>) Having therefore theſe Promiſes, let
us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthyneſs of fleſh and ſpirit, perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
holyneſs in the fear of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Job</hi> knew, That his Redeemer lived, and that he ſhould
live with him; and yet, as to <hi>holineſs</hi> and <hi>integrity, Not a
man like him in all the Earth.</hi> And that holy Man <hi>Aſaph</hi>
was fully aſſured of Perſevering infallibly, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 24, <hi>Thou
ſhalt guide me by thy Counſel, and afterward Receive me to
Glory.</hi> This did not looſen the Reigns, but made him cleave
cloſer to God, Renouncing all but Him and His ſervice;
<hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee?</hi> v. 25: And, <hi>It is good for
Me to draw nigh to God,</hi> v. 28. The like frame of Spirit we
find in <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 23, [<hi>Surely,] Goodneſs and Mercy ſhall
follow me all the dayes of my life;</hi> His Reſult alſo, is, <hi>I will
dwell in the houſe of God for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, that theſe were not temporary fits and flaſhes, but
from a ſtled Principle; is further apparent by his manner
of Reaſoning, in Pſal. 27. 5, 6, <hi>In time of trouble He ſhall
hide me in His pavillion:</hi> (no ſafer place on Earth, nor in
Heaven:)<note place="margin">Luke 12. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>and now ſhall my head be lifted up above mine
Enemies round about me.</hi> What follows upon this Mounted
Aſſurance? <hi>Soul, take thy eaſe, eat, drink, and be merry?</hi>
O No! But, [<hi>Therefore] will I offer Sacrifices of Joy; I
will ſing, yea, I will ſing praiſes unto the Lord!</hi> He was
now upon his <hi>high-places,</hi> out of the Reach of danger;
but did not grow Remiſs upon it, Reſtrain Prayer, and give<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
Calling upon God; but falls the more ſervently upon
that which ſhall be the Upſhot of all in Heaven: He would
rather have been Remiſs <hi>without</hi> this Aſſurance, as himſelf
confeſſeth at the 13. verſe, <hi>I had fainted, unleſs I had believed
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:60927:134"/>
to ſee the Goodneſs of the Lord in the land of the living.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul s</hi> aſſurance of obtaining what he ran-for, was a
Mighty ſtrengthening to him in his Race: Who ſo Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
to the World as <hi>Paul?</hi> ſo abundant in all kind of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
or more ready to dye for Chriſt, than he? Who yet
had the fulleſt Aſſurance of holding-out, and of Receiving
the Crown of Righteouſneſs at laſt; And, that Nothing
ſhould ſeparate him from it.</p>
               <p>By theſe ye may gather, That Believers are of a Nobler
Extract, than to love God <hi>the leſs,</hi> becauſe He loves them
<hi>ſo Much;</hi> and that 'tis no trivial Slaunder to Inſinuate, That
Believers, (eſpecially, ſuch as have Aſſurance,) are moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
and given to backſliding: Which is (ſure) an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
conſequent of their being <hi>Sealed to the day of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</hi>
Such objections do alſo argue the Authors of them
Not well-acquainted with the good ways of God; Nor with
that ſpiritual obligeing ſweetneſs that is found in them;
Which any One who hath taſted thereof in truth, would not
Turn-from, altho his future happineſs were not concern'd
in it. Nor do they Conſider the frame and nature of the
New Creature; which hath ſpiritual ſenſes, fitted to diſcern
what makes for its own preſervation, and what makes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it. Had you Fifteen years added to your life, and a
<hi>Certainty</hi> of it; Would you therfore forſake your food, and
diſuſe the ordinary means of preſerving life? The <hi>Jews</hi> had
an Abſolute Promiſe, That God would ſave <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> from
the King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> (who then beſieged it;) Did they ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ope
their Gates, and draw off their Guards upon it? Senſe
and Reaſon would teach them Otherwiſe; Which Grace
does not deſtroy, but perfect. It is a ſparkle of that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
fire, which cannot live out of its Element; nor can all
the Waters under Heaven, quench it. It is a part of the
Divine Nature, and ſo loves and hates, as the Father of it
doth; and It will cleave to Him in every State: If <hi>He ſave
me Alive,</hi> I'l <hi>Serve Him; If He kill me, I'l yet truſt in him;</hi>
In life and in death, I will be the Lord's. This is the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
diſpoſition of the New Creature; It favours only the
things which are of God: And the higher-taſted They are
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:60927:135"/>
by Aſſurance, the more is he Aloft, and above the lure of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Divertiſements; Not to be Reigned or led by them.
Therefore, Let God be true, and His Prophets and Apoſtles
be reckoned for faithfull Witneſſes; And every one that
ſpeaks Otherwiſe, a lyar.</p>

Blank in your ſtory, a blot in your Scutcheon of honour.
When you ſhall ſee, What Contrivances have been againſt

               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Infer. II.</note> Let us ſtudy more the Knowledg and Contents
of this Great truth, of <hi>Believers Invincible Perſeverance;</hi>
the Riſe, Progreſs, and Tendency of it; and what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
it yields us; which (indeed) are many and very
conſiderable.</p>
               <p>1. As it is a part of the Doctrine of Election; which teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
That Nothing in us, but Grace and love in God, was
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:60927:136"/>
the only Original Cauſe of our Salvation: The knowledge
whereof will work in the Soul, an holy Ingenuity and love
towards God, whom nothing offends but Sin. <hi>Simon</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
right,<note place="margin">Luke 7. 43.</note> when he ſaid, <hi>He that had moſt forgiven him,
would love moſt:</hi> Whence it follows, That he who believes
the Free Remiſſion of all his ſins from firſt to laſt; muſt needs
love God <hi>more</hi> than One who believes only the pardon of
thoſe that are paſt, and <hi>that</hi> ſo, as that they may all be
charged upon him agen: Or if not, That yet he may po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſibly
periſh for thoſe to-come; perhaps in the laſt Moment
of his life; For, he is not ſure (Nay, 'tis very doubtfull, if de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
on his own natural will) That Faith or Repentance
ſhall be his laſt Act.</p>
               <p>Now, This Grace of Love being the ſtrongeſt and moſt
operative Principle; he that is led by it muſt act according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
that is,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 16.</note> Vigorouſly, and without wearineſs, as <hi>Paul</hi>
did. And <hi>Joſeph,</hi> having received large Tokens of God's
love to him, and expecting more yet; argues againſt and
(with an holy diſdain and ſleight of hand) puts-by the
Temptation, <hi>How can I doe this, and ſin againſt God,</hi> who
hath dealt, and will deal, ſo bountifully with me!</p>
               <p>2. As it teacheth the ſoul to Depend upon God for its
keeping, as having His Almighty Power abſolutely enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
for it: Whereas, if the efficacy and event of all that God
doth <hi>for</hi> Me, ſhould depend upon ſomething to be done <hi>by</hi>
Me, who am a frail Creature, and prone to Revolt; I ſhould
ſtill be in fear, becauſe ſtill in danger of Falling, and loſing
all at laſt: And this Fear, being an enfeebling paſſion, muſt
needs render my Reſiſtance and all my endeavours, both
irregular and weak: Whereas a Magnanimous and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
ſpirit, who ſees himſelf Clothed with a <hi>Divine Power,</hi>
ſhall have his Wits (as we ſay) more about him; to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
Dangers and Advantages; and conſequently, how to
eſchew the one, and improve the other.</p>
               <p>3. As it gives aſſurance, <hi>Our labour ſhall not be in vain:</hi>
This made thoſe believing Hebrews to <hi>endure that great
fight of afflictions, and to take joyfully the ſpoiling of their

                  <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 33, 34.</note> becauſe <hi>they [knew] they had: in Heaven a better

               <p>1. Lay-aſide, and Caſt-away every weight, eſpecially
the ſin that doth moſt eaſily beſet you; your boſom ſin,
whatſoever it be;<note place="margin">Iſa. 2. 20. 1 Theſ. 5. 5, 6</note> Caſt them to the Moles and to the Batts:
They are not fit-Mates for Day-light Creatures: It is a
Noble prize you Run-for; Therefore, Clogg not your
ſelf with any thing that may hinder, or retard your pace.</p>
               <p>2. Keep your ſelves in the Love of God: that is, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>up
and maintain a ſpiritual ſenſe of His love to you, and a
lively anſwer of holy affections towards Him. Whatever
may tend to obſcure or leſſen your ſenſe of it, have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to doe with that unjuſt thing; keep your ſelf from
Idols; let nothing have an intereſt in your love but God; and
all things els, but in ſubordination and with reſpect to
Him onely.</p>
               <p>3. Watch againſt the Beginnings and firſt Motions of
ſin; Nip it in the bud; Abſtain from all appearance of evil;
and walk not on the brink of your liberty. It is eaſier to
keep-out an Invader than to Expell him being Entred; To
keep-down a Rebel, and prevent his Riſing, than to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
him when he is up. Great and black Clouds have
ſmall beginnings; the bigneſs of your hand (at firſt,) may
riſe and ſpread, to cover the whole Heavens. Therefore,
keep-off ſin at ſtaffs end.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="264" facs="tcp:60927:137"/>
4. Be diligent and induſtrious in it: Think not, becauſe
it is God who performeth all things for you, that therefore
you may ſit-ſtill, or be Remiſs in your duty; your Arms
and Armour were not provided to Ruſt in your Tent. There
may be (indeed) ſuch a Juncture in Providence, that it
may be your duty (and ſo, your ſtrength) to ſit-ſtill; as
was theirs at the Red-ſea:<note place="margin">Exod. 14. 13.</note> This is, when all farther Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is ſhut-up to you; and then the Lord will doe His Work
without you: But uſually, There is ſomething to be done
on our part: Tho' the Lord would go-forth before <hi>David,</hi>
and ſmite the <hi>Philiſtims;</hi> yet <hi>David</hi> muſt beſtir himſelf:
This thing is conſtantly to be affirm'd,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 5. 24.</note> That <hi>they who have
believed in God, be careful to maintain good Works; Tit.</hi> 3. 8.
And do it the rather, <hi>To cut-off occaſion from them which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
occaſion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as
we,</hi> 2 Cor. 11. 12.</p>
               <p>5. Cleave to Jeſus Chriſt, and to Him only; and truſt not
to your holding of him, but to His holding of you: This did
<hi>David</hi> when he ſays,<note place="margin">Pſal. 73. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou holdeſt me by my Right hand.</hi> Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Him, as Men (whoſe dependence is upon it) follow the
Court: Whiles following Him, you cannot do amiſs;
nor want any good thing, whether for Councel, Strength, or
Otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>6. Forget what is behind, and preſs on towards perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
That if poſſible, you might attain to the Reſurrection of
the Dead; <hi>i. e.</hi> To be perfectly holy: Tho' Perfectneſs, in
the perfection of it, is not attainable here; yet, the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
you aim, the higher ſhall your Attainment be; and the
farther-off from loſing what you have. Keep the Mark
ſtill in your eye, and ſhun whatever might intercept your
Sight of it.</p>
               <p>Theſe are ſome of the ways to make your Calling and
Election ſure: And if ye do theſe things, ye ſhall prove
this Doctrine to be true; And either Prevent or Retort
thoſe Carnal and groundleſs Calumnies that are brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Infer. IV.</note> Since there are ſuch Arguments for Believers In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
Perſeverance; Let us all ſo demean our ſelves, That
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:60927:137"/>
we may have them <hi>all</hi> ſtand on our ſide, for proof and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
That we are of that happy Remnant, whom the Great
God hath ſet-apart for himſelf; And whom He hath made
and wrought for this ſelf ſame thing; And as it was His pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
ſo let it be our Spirit and practice, to glorifie His Rich
Grace.</p>
               <p>1. If born of God, let us ſhew-forth the virtues of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and bear our ſelves as His Children, both towards
Him, and towards the World: Let us live upon Him, and
live to Him; Rejoycing always before Him; firſt, for <hi>His</hi>
Own bleſſedneſs, and then for <hi>our</hi> own as derived from His,
and by Him reſerv'd in Heaven for us; And all, as deſigning
to honour Him as our Father.</p>
               <p>2. If we have Faith, let it appear by our Works:
It muſt be ſome <hi>ſingular</hi> thing that muſt diſtinguiſh
us from other Men: It is not profeſſion, Nor Words, Nor
Actions neither (as to the Matter of them, and ſo farr as
viſible to Men,) that will approve us Believers; but the
<hi>Principle</hi> whence they grow, and the <hi>End</hi> they drive at; The
Reſult of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s faith was, <hi>To give Glory to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Let us carry our ſelves under all diſpenſations not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
quietly but thankfully; and ſo as to Anſwer God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s End:
Walk humbly; Hate the thing that's evil; Have the
World under your feet; Eſteem preciouſly of Chriſt; Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
His Ordinances; let every Grace have its perfect
work; and Rejoyce in hopes of that glory, which all theſe
things are preparatory to.</p>
               <p>4. If One with Chriſt, and He our Mediator; Then let
us walk as He walked; who held His own Will alwaies
ſubject to His Father's; Reckoning it <hi>His Meat to do His
Will,</hi> and to <hi>finiſh His Work:</hi> Let us alſo wait His Advice
and Counſel in every buſineſs, and follow it; Commit
our Cauſe to Him, and Intereſt Him in all our Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>5. Apply our ſelves to every Attribute of God, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the preſent occaſion; and dwell upon them, and leave

to live upon: Let it not be ſaid, That in the midſt of our
abundance we are in ſtreights!</p>
               <p>6. If made for the Glory of God, Make-good your End:
He is <hi>glorious in Holineſs,</hi> and by Holineſs onely can you
glorifie Him. Bear (therefore) on the forehead of your
Deſigns and Converſation, that Royal Inſcription [<hi>Holineſs
to the Lord:</hi>] By this, you will ſet-to your ſeal, That <hi>God
is true;</hi> and approve your ſelves to be <hi>Children that will
not lie.</hi> 'Twill alſo be of ſingular uſe and ſervice to your
ſelves, as to that <hi>other</hi> End of your Being: That you have
<hi>glorified God on the Earth,</hi> will be a ſubſtantial argument
That <hi>He will glorifie you</hi> in the World to come.<note place="margin">Joh. 17. 14.</note> For, tho

will be your <hi>beſt evidence</hi> (next the immediate witneſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of the Spirit) that you <hi>have</hi> a Title, and that your Title
is <hi>good.</hi> Since, therfore, we were made for, and expect ſuch
things,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>What manner of perſons ought we to be, in all holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation

               </p>
               <p>7. If under the Covenant of Grace, let us reckon our ſelves
ſtrengthened with all might, and hold to it, as having all
our ſalvation in it; Both Keeping, Support, Recovery
and Settlement, Grace and Glory. Not Minding ſo much
how any thing looks or feels at preſent; but what is the
End it tends-to; For if the End be good, the Means (as ſuch)
cannot be otherwiſe. And truly, we cannot have a better e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of our Intereſt in this Covenant,<note place="margin">Iſa. 56. 4 &amp; 6.</note> than a total Devol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of our ſelves upon it.</p>
               <p>And well it is for us, (who find in our Selves ſuch a prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to backſlide,) That our Eternal condition doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
on our ſelves;<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 19.</note> but upon <hi>that foundation of God</hi> menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
in <hi>Timothy;</hi> where the Apoſtle, ſpeaking of ſome who
had made Ship-wreck of the faith, leſt true Believers ſhould
faint in their minds, at the ſight and apprehenſion of it; he
tells them, That <hi>Nevertheleſs</hi> (that is, Notwithſtanding this
wofull backſliding of ſome, perhaps of eminent profeſſion,
yet) <hi>the foundation of God ſtandeth ſure;</hi> q. d. They that are
of this Foundation are ſure to be kept: And he firms it with
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:60927:138"/>
this Seal, <hi>The Lord knoweth them that are His:</hi> He knows
whom He hath <hi>Choſen,</hi> and concerning whom He hath <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanted,</hi>
That <hi>they ſhall not depart from Him;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
He will not let them go; (They ſhall be kept as thoſe
Seaven thouſand were, from bowing the knee to <hi>Baal.</hi>) Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
this Caution withall, <hi>That every one which nameth the
Name of the Lord, ſhould depart from iniquity;</hi> Which, as
it is a Means of God's appointing, to keep from Apoſtacy;
So, it ſhall be to them an <hi>evidence,</hi> That they are of that
Foundation, and ſhall be kept. For, it being his ſcope, to
Comfort believers againſt their Miſgivings, which ariſe from
a ſenſe of their own weakneſs, and a like aptneſs in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to Revolt; He needs muſt uſe an Argument ſuited to
ſuch an End: And therefore, in ſaying [<hi>The foundation of
God ſtandeth ſure;</hi>] He muſt intend, Believers ſtanding-ſure
upon it: For, The ſtanding-ſure of the foundation, would be
ſmall Comfort to us, if yet We might be blown off it, or ſink
beſides it.</p>
               <p>Does God take care for Sparrows? for Oxen? for Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens?
Much more for believing ſouls, who have Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
themſelves to His keeping. Let the Fowler do all he can,
Not a ſparrow ſhall fall to the ground: you'l ſay, With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Will of God, they cannot? And the Will of God
is, That they ſhall not: (<hi>A thouſand may fall at his ſide, and
ten thouſand at his right hand;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 91. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>but it ſhall not come nigh him.</hi>)
He that determin'd ſuch a ſparrow ſhall not fall; determin'd
alſo, to keep him from that as would <hi>cauſe</hi> him to fall: And
therefore, either the Fowler ſhall not find the Bird; or the
Bird ſhall diſcern his approach, or ſmell the powder, and be
gon: Or, if he ſhoot, he ſhall miſs his mark; Or if he hit, it
ſhall light-on the feathers that will grow-agen; Or, on ſome
fleſhy part, that may be lick'd whole; Or perhaps, it ſhall
open an Ulcer that could not otherwiſe be Cured: A Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's
<hi>heel</hi> may be bruiſed, but his <hi>vital-parts</hi> are out of Reach,
and therefore ſafe.</p>
               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">Infer. V.</note> Let this Doctrine of Believer's invincible perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance

               <p>1. That tho' the New Nature ſhall certainly expunge the

for your preſent relief; That the Beſt Principle is ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant
and getting ground, (how ever your preſent ſenſe
may judge of it;) and the old party ſhall never recover its
Waſting condition: For, the Kingdom of God once in the
heart, will ſurely Work and ſpread it ſelf, till the whole

divers Parables in the Goſpell.)<note place="margin">Mat. 13, 31, 33. chap. 25. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>To him that [hath] ſhall be

                  <hi>ſo He will make
your way perfect.</hi> Suppoſe, that Faith and Holineſs be at
preſent, but as two little flocks of kids; And ſin (like the
<hi>Syrians</hi> Army) fills the Countrey: Be not diſmayed; The
king of <hi>Iſrael</hi> will cleer the Countrey of them: His ſpirit
ſhall lift up a Standard againſt them; and though they come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
like a floud, by Him ſhall their proud waves be ſtayed.
The Lord ſays to you in this Caſe as He did to <hi>Jeremy; I
have made thee an Iron Pillar and brazen Walls, againſt the
whole land: They ſhall fight againſt thee, but they ſhall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
againſt thee:</hi> Jer. 1. 18, 19. Or as once to His People,
concerning the Gyant Og; <hi>Fear him not, For I have deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him into thy hand, with all his Army.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. This Sickneſs is not unto death: The Conflict is not to
weaken or deſtroy, but for the tryal and improvement of
your faith and other Graces: The very <hi>tryal</hi> whereof is
a <hi>precious</hi> thing,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 7.</note> and ſhall be <hi>found ſo</hi> at laſt; both to the
Glory of Him that tryes you, and yours who are tryed: <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,
David, Job,</hi> and others, are pregnant examples of
this; They came-forth like Gold; More pure, ſolid, and
flexible. <hi>David</hi> indeed, tho' he held-faſt his confidence a
great while; yet ſtill being purſued and Over-preſt, Every
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:60927:139"/>
day involv'd in dangers anew; and having once admitted
Carnal Reaſon to be of his Councel, he began to flagg in his
faith, (<hi>I ſhall one day periſh,</hi>—and <hi>All men are lyars</hi>-) But it
was in his <hi>haſte,</hi> Not conſidering the <hi>ſureneſs</hi> of an Abſolute
Promiſe: He therefore (when he had better weighed it)
confeſſes his fault, and Recovers from it: And his faith was
<hi>improv'd</hi> by his tryal; For, being come agen-to it-ſelf, he
comfortably concludes, That <hi>Goodneſs and Mercy ſhall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
him all the days of his life;</hi> and (Notwithſtanding his
preſent exile) <hi>he ſhall dwell in the houſe of the Lord for
ever.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>3. Be it alwaies Remembred, That God reckon's of a man
according to what his <hi>Mind</hi> is; And you ought ſo alſo to
reckon of your ſelf: This was <hi>Paul's</hi> courſe, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.

                  <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>but ſin that dwelleth in Me. Before</hi>
Converſion it was <hi>Saul,</hi> but <hi>Now</hi> 'tis <hi>Sin.</hi> Believers may
be led-captive (at-times) even after they have ſworn fealty
to their true Lord; But <hi>ſtill</hi> they are <hi>His</hi> in their <hi>Mind,</hi> and
that's their Mark. It is the ſame with that in <hi>John; Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is born of God, doth not Commit ſin;</hi> And, <hi>he cannot ſin,
becauſe he is born of God:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>i. e.</hi> He does not, nor he cannot
ſin, as the Devil's children do; for their Wills are in it; (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>John.</hi> 8. 44, <hi>The luſts of your father [ye will do:</hi>]
But, a Regenerate perſon, <hi>The evil he doth, he [Allows not:</hi>]
And this is a ſtaying Conſideration, That if <hi>with our Mind
we ſerve the law of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 25.</note> it ſhall not Ruin us, that <hi>with our fleſh
we ſerve the law of Sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But how ſhall I know it? If you be <hi>forced,</hi> you will <hi>Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out;</hi>
and if you <hi>Cry,</hi> it is a <hi>Rape;</hi> and ſhall not be charged to
your accompt: ye have the Law for it, in <hi>Deut.</hi> 22. 25, 26, 27.
So,<note place="margin">Exod. 21, 13. with Deut. 19. 4, 6.</note> he that kills a Man [<hi>againſt his Will</hi>] is not reckoned a
Murtherer, Nor worthy of death; albeit, the Act it ſelf, be
the ſame that another Man, whoſe <hi>will</hi> was in it, ſhall dye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for.</p>
               <p>4. Believers are <hi>Trees of Righteouſneſs, and of the Lord's
own planting;</hi> and therefore, <hi>they ſhall not fear when heat

                  </gap>t other Rules and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of War,) bear in mind theſe few following:</p>
               <p>1. Intangle not your ſelf; but ſhun and avoid whatever
may prove a clog, or unfit you for duty.</p>
               <p>2. Exerciſe yourſelf in things that will teach you to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
your Arms; and tending to Nouriſh your faith.</p>
               <p>3. Stand on your Guard watchfully; that ye be not
ſurpriſed by ſudden excurſions, or under pretence of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
               <p>4. Arm your ſelf with the ſame Mind that was in Chriſt;
ſet your face as a flint, and conclude, That <hi>ye ſhall not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. Submit to the place your General hath ſet you in. It
muſt have been ſome bodie's lot, and why not yours? and
the hotter it is, the more honourable.</p>
               <p>6. Look that ye fight with proper weapons; which are
onely to be had at the Covenant of Grace, and the Croſs of
Chriſt; And <hi>There</hi> they are never wanting: And be ſure,
ye go not down to the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> either to forge or ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen.</p>
               <p>7. Fight not as one that beats the ayr; but as having (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed)
a ſturdy adverſary to deal-with; whom yet you are
<hi>ſure to Overcome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>8. Look ſtill on your Captain, to obſerve what He ſays
and Does, and do likewiſe: To take-up your Croſs, and
endure hardſhip, are neceſſary accoutrements to a Soldier
of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>9. Wait on the Lord to Renew your Strength; who
then beſtirrs Himſelf moſt, when your ſtrength is gon;
Then He lays hold upon Shield and Buckler,<note place="margin">Pſ. 35. 2.</note> and ſtands<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>up
for your help.</p>
               <p>10. Laſtly, (and to Influence all) Mind the Lord of his
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:60927:141"/>
Covenant; even <hi>Then,</hi> when (it may be) your ſelf think
on it with trouble, as doubting your intereſt in it: Pray
Him to remember it for you; and with the ſame Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will
wherewith He made it: Beſeech Him to look-on His
Bow in the Cloud, which Himſelf hath ſet there, as a ſure
ſign between God and you; That tho' the skies be Red and
lowring, The Clouds return after the Rain, and the Billows
go-over your head; you ſhall not be deluged by them: By
this it is, that ye are hedged-about, and walled-up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
Therefore, Stand not like Men in ſuſpenſe; as unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to fall-on; or doubtful how to come-off; But
On, On, the day's your Own; The Lord of Hoſts purſues
them; And <hi>let all the Sons of God ſhout for joy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly,<note place="margin">Infer. VI.</note> ſince Believers onely are intereſſed in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and that Faith is a Neceſſary Inſtrument which the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
wil not work without; &amp; without which, you cannot
work with it, Nor ſee your Intereſt in it; Look-well to your
Faith: firſt, That it be of the right kind; (<hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces
Self, &amp; lives upon Grace;) And then, having found
it ſuch, Be ſure ye keep it well, and improve it to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt.
Two uſes, eſpecially, are to be made of it; (1) As
your <hi>Shield,</hi> to ſupply the place of all other peeces of your
Armour, when broken or looſe; as well as to ſafeguard
them, when they are whole and Tite about you. If your
helmet be out of the way, and fiery darts come pouring
down; Hold up your Faith between your head and them;
Faith is the trueſt quench-coal to the fire of hell. If your
Sword be forgot, or laid-aſide, or wants an edge, &amp;c. your
Shield, if well applyed, will Retort your enemies weapons
on his own Pate. (2) Faith is your ſpiritual Optick, which
ſhews you things of <hi>Greateſt</hi> Moment; and <hi>Not Otherwiſe</hi>
Viſible: Even Chariots and horſmen of <hi>Fire,</hi> are not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernible
without it. If temptations from the World do
indanger you; Turn your Faith that way, and through it
view and conſider, how Shallow and ſhort-liv'd the pleaſures
of it are; and how Momentany your ſufferings. Then
look-at the World to come; The Glory of it, and your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
in it; And how much your Crown will be Brightened
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:60927:141"/>
by the ſcowrings you have paſs'd-under here; and dwell
on the contemplation of it. Bend not your eye ſo much on
the peril or length of your paſſage, as on the long'd-for
ſhore that lies beyond it; And reckon the Surges of that
dreadfull gulph (which is yet betwixt you and It) but as ſo
many ſtrokes to waft you Thither.<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 26.</note> This was the courſe
that <hi>Moſes</hi> took, and Chriſt Himſelf: Nothing ſo blunts
the edge of Satan's temptations,<note place="margin">Chap. 12. 2.</note> or the World's, as this
Faith of God's Elect.</p>
               <p>Therefore, ſee that you hold-faſt your Faith; Keep it as
your life; (keep That, and it will keep you;) and let it not
go until ye die. Then (indeed) it will leave you, becauſe then
it will have done you all the ſervice it can; even the whole
of what it was ordained-for. But, ſhall I ſay, That Faith will
then be diſſolv'd and go-to-nothing? I would rather expreſs
it as the Apoſtle doth the ſtate of the ſaints, that ſhall be
found alive at Chriſt's coming,<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 4. 17.</note> [<hi>They ſhall not die, but they
ſhall be changed.</hi>] Faith ſhall <hi>Then</hi> be turned into <hi>Sight,</hi> and
we ſhall have the Real preſence, Full poſſeſſion, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
immixed fruition, of that Bleſſedneſs we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
and hoped-for.</p>
               <p>7. Gather hence,<note place="margin">Phil. 1. 23.</note> both the <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Rationality</hi> of the
Saints deſires to be diſſolv'd: They <hi>knew,</hi> that when this
Earthly Tabernacle went-down,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 1, 2.</note> they had a <hi>better,</hi> and more
<hi>capacious</hi> building in Heaven. They alſo found, That ſpirits,
whiles dwelling in Fleſh, are too-much ſtreightned and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
either to <hi>bear</hi> the Glory they were made-for, or to
expreſs an anſwerable thankfulneſs for it: And for this
they groned; Not to be unclothed, (as weary of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
